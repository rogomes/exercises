Agrifarm A / S has entered into an agreement with farmer Anders Gunnarsson, Kvänum in Sweden, for an Intellifarm stable of approx. 4,200 m2. The Intellifarm stable at Anders is prepared so that air cleaning can be established to minimize the ammonia emmision and thereby the Agri AirClean® air cleaner can also become part of the project in the long term. Quick start of construction. The construction starts as soon as the winter stop in March / April, and must be completed by the end of the year. “We are very pleased that we now managed to get the house concept Intellifarm® to be widely used in Sweden” and look forward to getting started at Anders Gunnarsson, says Product Manager at Agrifarm Poul Erik Christensen. Anders Gunnarsson sees great opportunities for the Intellifarm® stable concept in Sweden, which he believes meet a number of the requirements and wishes the Swedish consumers have for breeding pigs, including large lighting and focus on high animal welfare. “We visited Agrifarm and saw the stable at Peder Rasmussen at Aarhus last summer. I was very excited. Even in this hot period, we experienced a stable with a significantly better stable climate than what we normally see. I had no doubt that it was this stable I wanted, ”says Anders Gunnarsson. Export strategy Export is part of our strategy, both in terms of the Intellifarm stable and the Agri AirClean air cleaner. That is why we are extremely pleased that the stable concept has now been sold to the Swedish market, says Managing Director Hans Jørgen Pedersen.

Agri AirClean is modular to accommodate the need for air cleaning in your stable. Agri AirClean Agri AirClean is a chemical air cleaner that effectively removes ammonia and odor emissions from all stables and all breeds of domestic animals. The cleaner is particularly suitable for spot / floor extraction where the concentration of ammonia and odor is particularly high. Agri AirClean is designed to be used in open stables, also cow stables, and therefore low temperatures do not prevent the air cleaning. After a stop, the cleaning process can be restarted with full power and is therefore particularly useful in all outputs in production of, for example, finishers. Greater production and better bottom line Agri AirClean makes it possible to gather more animals on fewer production units, thereby supporting efficient and economically sustainable livestock production, and better utilization of employee resources, benefiting your bottom line. You produce your own NS fertilizer of the spared ammonia and chemistry, and therefore the Agri AirClean is an economically efficient air cleaner. Smartfarm Agri AirClean is controlled, regulated and monitored via the Smartfarm operating system. The function of Agri AirClean is fully automated and does not require manual control and monitoring. By Ph and conductivity measurement, correct amounts of supply of chemistry and drainage of the emitted emissions (fertilizer / waste) are ensured. Monitoring of the liquid circuit and fans ensures alarm call in case of failure. Agri AirClean QUESTION FORNAVN * EFTERNAVN * EMAIL ADRESSE * TELEFONNUMMER EMNE HVAD KAN VI HJÆLPE MED?

Get a non-binding conversation Share Concepts Download UK pdf Concepts & Technologies Intellifarm for Finishers Intellifarm for Piglets Intellifarm Gestation Intellifarm Dairy Cows Agri AirCleaning Cattle Agri AirClean SmartFarm Slurry Separation Agrifarm has developed the Intellifarm stable concept that benefits the environment, the animals and the economy With Intellifarm you get a better environment, increase animal welfare and reduce energy consumption. The stable concept Intellifarm focuses on energy saving, reduction of stable environmental impact and good overall economy. The stable type is built for large production, therefore it also has a width of 30-60 meters in the pig stables and up to 75 meters in livestock farms. It provides a more square and compact building, a smaller construction area and a stable with a good overview of the animals. Intellifarm is equipped with a innovative ventilation principle, hybrid ventilation, where technology combines natural ventilation with a floor extraction which ultimately causes low energy levels. It is only the mechanical ventilation in the floor drain that is energy consuming. The indoor climate, and thereby animal welfare in Intellifarm, has been significantly improved. The large air exchange / aircleaning in Intellifarm is beneficial to the animals, and the interaction between natural ventilation and floor extraction makes it possible to collect most of the ammonia and odor emissions and at the same time for hot periods to lower the heat emission from the animals with a good pen ventillation. The result of the improved indoor climate is seen in less stressed animals and a better production economy. 5 benchmarks in the development of our Intellifarm stables Production safety for the farmer. We choose safe and proven solutions combined with innovation, bringing livestock production to a higher level, productive and profit-making. Energy saving. We want to contribute to achieving a greener profile for agriculture, while ensuring a better bottom line for the farmer. Reduction of environmental impact. The Intellifarm stables collect most ammonia and odor emissions. Thereby, the farmer effectively reduces the burden on the local community, while at the same time achieving the opportunity to establish greater livestock production without increasing pollution and no neighboring genes. Effective logistics. By building wider and more square buildings, we improve the traffic in the stables, while at the same time you typically achieve a smaller construction area, ie. that the total construction fills less. Animal welfare. Good well-proven solutions combined with innovation in ventilation and climate contribute to increased animal welfare.

Get a non-binding conversation Share Concepts Download UK pdf Concepts & Technologies Intellifarm for Finishers Intellifarm for Piglets Intellifarm Gestation Intellifarm Dairy Cows Agri AirCleaning Cattle Agri AirClean SmartFarm Slurry Separation Agrifarm has developed the Intellifarm stable concept that benefits the environment, the animals and the economy With Intellifarm you get a better environment, increase animal welfare and reduce energy consumption. The stable concept Intellifarm focuses on energy saving, reduction of stable environmental impact and good overall economy. The stable type is built for large production, therefore it also has a width of 30-60 meters in the pig stables and up to 75 meters in livestock farms. It provides a more square and compact building, a smaller construction area and a stable with a good overview of the animals. Intellifarm is equipped with a innovative ventilation principle, hybrid ventilation, where technology combines natural ventilation with a floor extraction which ultimately causes low energy levels. It is only the mechanical ventilation in the floor drain that is energy consuming. The indoor climate, and thereby animal welfare in Intellifarm, has been significantly improved. The large air exchange / aircleaning in Intellifarm is beneficial to the animals, and the interaction between natural ventilation and floor extraction makes it possible to collect most of the ammonia and odor emissions and at the same time for hot periods to lower the heat emission from the animals with a good pen ventillation. The result of the improved indoor climate is seen in less stressed animals and a better production economy. 5 benchmarks in the development of our Intellifarm stables Production safety for the farmer. We choose safe and proven solutions combined with innovation, bringing livestock production to a higher level, productive and profit-making. Energy saving. We want to contribute to achieving a greener profile for agriculture, while ensuring a better bottom line for the farmer. Reduction of environmental impact. The Intellifarm stables collect most ammonia and odor emissions. Thereby, the farmer effectively reduces the burden on the local community, while at the same time achieving the opportunity to establish greater livestock production without increasing pollution and no neighboring genes. Effective logistics. By building wider and more square buildings, we improve the traffic in the stables, while at the same time you typically achieve a smaller construction area, ie. that the total construction fills less. Animal welfare. Good well-proven solutions combined with innovation in ventilation and climate contribute to increased animal welfare.

Test facilities for sows and piglets production will be built in Kibæk. 2008 We will begin the development of the concept stables based on industrial production and logistics. The superior is raised high from the outset, operating economy, animal welfare, energy consumption and environmental impact. We're going to Agromek for the first time. We submit the first patent application on the conical channels © etc. for livestock production. 2007 The idea is born – the estimate is that there will be fewer farms, but with significantly more animals and thus larger buildings and facilities. Clear objective – we do not want to do what is already on the market. We will be pre-qualified for 4 out of a total of 6 buildings in RealDania's competition for the future of agricultural construction. We get first place, second place and third place in the RealDania competition for the future of agricultural construction. Unfortunately, first place was never achieved because of the financial situation.

Lars’s Intellifarm for Finishers will be constructed with large-scale pen with weight sorting. The Intellifarm stable at Lars is for the future of expansion prepared for Agri AirClean Air Cleaning, which reduces the impact of the stable on the environment and this future-proof Lars Jensen’s business, as production can later be doubled. The stable contains: 6000 plots in large pens to an annual output of approx. 25,000 fattening pigs Hybrid ventilation – better stable climate with less energy consumption High pressure cooling – cooling of the stable and bleeding before washing Slurry cooling provides the heat to the stable, respectively. underfloor heating and room heating Wide corridors ensure fast exit when pigs are to be delivered.

The average operator is using 6-8 different portals to monitor its plants. On top of that, most of these portals are the solution provided by inverter OEMs, which are mostly fine for personal use, but lack features as a professional tool. Exel Solar, one of the leading solar PV distributor companies in Mexico, noticed these inefficiencies and made it its mission to find a professional, hardware-independent solution for the Mexican market. After almost a year of thorough research, they were down to 4 possible solutions. Exel Solar announced on February 2nd 2020 that they picked us as its monitoring solution. \\u201cChoosing the right monitoring partner is a crucial decision in our growth strategy, so we put a lot of time into research and comparison to make sure we choose the best option for us and especially for all of our customers,\\u201d says Daniel Alejandro Duque Flores, C&I and Projects Director at Exel Solar. \\u201cNext to features, the solution had to be easy to use but also strong and dynamic to grow at the same pace our market is growing. Fast onboarding of PV-plants and low recurring costs are also very important factors if we want to scale. After 8 months of intensive research, we chose Solytic. We really liked the interface optimized for boosting our productivity. Just the fact that we can now monitor all our plants from a single portal without installing any new components, is just amazing. If we want to monitor thousands of plants, we need to be as effective as possible. That combined with the attractive pricing structure enables us to charge half the price for monitoring to our customers compared with the other solutions.\\u201d Exel Solar plans to onboard more than 1000 plants in 2020 to our monitoring portal. The onboarding itself and the customer support will be provided by Exel Solar. Although we monitor more than 100,000 plants in over 42 countries, we mainly focussed our marketing and sales efforts on our home markets \\u2013 Germany, Austria and Switzerland \\u2013 in our first 2 years since founding. But with our recent series A funding round we are now prepared to expand internationally. As our first partnership in the Americas, this marks an important milestone for Solytic. Exel Solar has the experience, the resources, local market insights and strategic foresight to make this very successful. Opening our own offices all over the world would take a lot of resources that we would rather use to make our product better. That\\u2019s why we prefer to cooperate with strong partners like Exel Solar. Become a partner?

We secured a medium seven-digit sum in our Series A round. The investment is led by Swedish energy company Vattenfall \\u2014 onboard since 2017 \\u2014 and EWE the Oldenburg-based energy company. Furthermore, a number of business angels join as additional investors, including THELO Investors. In just two years, we have become a leading service company in the field of data management for photovoltaic (PV) plants. We are the only company on the market that uses data from PV plants in a purely software-based solution to accelerate amortisation through comprehensively optimised performance. The bottom line is that our customers reach the breakeven point more quickly because they achieve a higher return on investment throughout the entire life cycle of the PV plant. The Series A financing will accelerate product development and international expansion. We currently employ 25 people and monitor more than 100,000 PV plants. The goal is to service one million plants within the next three years. For us, this cooperation on an equal footing with two of the five largest companies in Germany is an important step forward and confirmation that Solytic is on the right track. It gives us the necessary clout to further expand digital services in the solar market and to gain a strong market position. Without an immense expansion of power generation by solar plants, the energy transition to a CO2-neutral world will not be possible. \\u201cThe energy industry is undergoing a rapid transformation process. Vattenfall\\u2019s goal is to enable a fossil-free life within one generation. A cornerstone of our strategy is the further expansion of renewable energies,\\u201d says Gunnar Groebler, Senior Vice President at Vattenfall. \\u201cWe see significant growth potential in the solar sector. However, economic success depends on constructing renewable plants as cost-effectively as possible and operating them with data support. Therefore, the investment in a company like Solytic, which is clearly focused on digital services in this future-oriented area, is a very sensible investment for Vattenfall\\u201d, Groebler continued. In order for the energy transition to gain momentum, the costs of generating solar power must continue to fall. Currently, PV plants pay for themselves within 8-15 years. Our customers want to reach the break-even point faster. That is why we rely on automated analyses that identify and exploit potential. Currently, there are around 1.7 million PV plants in Germany alone. However, in light of rising electricity prices and growing environmental awareness, it can be assumed that the expansion of solar energy will continue to grow significantly. This demand is meeting with an extremely fragmented supply from a wide range of different service providers and manufacturers. Most buyers of solar plants are mainly interested in the yields and their degree of self-sufficiency. In order to enable plant owners to minimize their expenses while maximizing their yield, Solytic continuously evaluates the plant data and reports weaknesses and potentials to the operators with concrete proposals for solutions. \\u201cAs an energy company we want to offer our customers simple and convenient solutions that reduce the complexity of their everyday lives,\\u201d says Dr. Urban Keussen, Board Member for Technology and Innovation at the Oldenburg-based energy company EWE. \\u201cFor us, this also includes services from partners such as Solytic, with which our customers can save time and money. The provision of such services is then a sustainable benefit for everyone involved,\\u201d Keussen continues.

How do I compare solar monitoring costs? We've done the math for you. There are different ways to look at the costs of a solar monitoring software. Since some of which vary with the size of your portfolio, we've broken down the main price groups. Total costs License costs Solytic is available for 20 cents per kWp per year, starting at a minimum of 60 \\u20ac. For smaller portfolios, solutions such as powerdoo's portal are cheaper. From a portfolio size of 100 kWp Solytic offers the lowest price. Setup costs The setup costs (one-offtime setup fee) were published by 6 providers. Solytic charges 0.50 \\u20ac per kWp, including introduction. With regards to the set up costs, hardware dependency should be considered. Although Powerdog and SMA charge no set up costs, according to manufacturer the monitoring solution exclusively works with its own paid hardware. Solar-Log WEB Enerest\\u2122 is also hardware-dependent, whereby the setup costs are only waived for residential-size systems up to 30 kWp. Gantner.webportal is the only other monitoring portal that officially declared to have a setup fee. It has a fixed component of 400 \\u20ac and a variable one of 30 \\u20ac per MWp. How come Solytic is up to 87% cheaper than other solutions? Solytic has developed cost advantages on three levels and passes them directly on to the customer: 1. \\\"Product First Strategy\\\": Our focus is on product and service. Solytic deliberately avoids costly sales and marketing channels. 2. Investments by strategic partners such as Vattenfall: research and development costs do not have to be passed on to the customer. 3. Modern software for the optimization of internal work processes: Economies of scale are converted into favourable conditions for customers. Tip: Use the Solytic cost calculator Cost-Calculator and determine your savings potential. Clearing the jungle: How to find out what I need? With more than 70 solutions offering different functions and prices, the software market for plant monitoring has become a price-quality labyrinth \\u2013 especially for C&I assets. To bring about transparency, Solytic has created a compact comparison for solar monitoring software solutions in this segment. Solar monitoring software to optimize processes While all-round expensive SCADA solutions have emerged offering the highest possible level of detail with many additional functions, there are also simple freeware solutions designed for the residential sector. Service providers for C&I assets however, have their own needs that are only satisfied by a few selected providers. For C&I monitoring, which often involves managing a mixed portfolio, the focus is on process optimization. Therefore, a monitoring software should be designed to support the processes of technical operation management in order to make repetitive tasks more efficient, such as tracking of yield-relevant errors and smooth communication and documentation by using an efficient ticketing and reporting system. The most important features explained: Ticketing sytem Eight out of nine PV monitoring solutions considered offer a ticketing system to initiate and manage work processes. In this way, interference can be prioritised and rectified as efficiently as possible. This is how Solytic does it: Not every company has the same work processes. We have therefore developed a ticketing system for the Solytic Portal that can individually reproduce the company-specific work processes. The ticketing system adapts to the work processes and not vice versa. Tickets can be generated manually both in the ticketing system and from the alarm messages (optionally also automatically for certain error types). Based on the ticket type, emails can be sent directly from the ticketing system to the responsible service provider or employee. Thus Solytic helps O&M professionals and Asset Managers to manage their work processes as effectively as possible. Automatic error recognition Automatic error detection is considered probably one of the most basic functions. Not surprisingly, it is also offered in all of the ten highlighted portals. As so often the difference lies in the details. Solytic does it this way: Solytic attaches great importance to ensuring that the user gets to the information they need as quickly as possible in order to be able to process errors as quickly as possible. Errors can be listed at portfolio, asset or device level. Recurring error images are grouped and errors are automatically marked as completed after processing. Interpretation of error patterns Interpreting error patterns helps O&M professionals to analyse and process them more efficiently, leading to more effective work planning and ultimately saving time and money. How Soyltic does it? Firstly, Solytic offers the display of system messages fed by the inverters and data loggers and secondly system specific alert messages. The user can filter and sort individually. The flexibility of the system's own alarm messages is currently being extended so that the user can also adapt this function to his own requirements. Basically, the Solytic portal offers filter and sort functions to quickly find the desired content. Calculation of financial losses of certain error patterns So far, only meteocontrol and QOS offer a draft version of an error cost calculation. Based on empirical values and error categories first loss calculations can be estimated. Soyltic does it this way: Like many software providers, Solytic plans to offer this feature in the near future. The accuracy of the calculation depends, of course, largely on the customer's willingness to share internal information (e.g. hourly rates for service personnel). Irradiation calculation based on satellite & sensor data Satellite and sensor data are used to calculate the local solar radiation at the location of solar assets. This target value is currently available at all compared software providers (Ensight by Envision only uses sensor data, no satellite data). See how Solytic does it: Solytic uses satellite and sensor data to calculate the specific target AC performance of an asset. In addition to the irradiation values, system parameters such as the orientation and inclination of the modules and the geoposition of the system are also taken into account. This is how the technical yield target value is calculated. If a asset produces less than technically possible in the long term, there is usually a need for a response. By dynamically weighing the various factors, the system learns continuously and the calculation becomes more accurate over time. Performance ratio The decisive factor for calculating the performance ratio is the data input. Find out how this is usually done, and also with Solytic: Calculated based on satellite measurements, the Performance Ratio generates meaningful results when looking at a longer period of time - usually one year. If, however, measurement data are collected on-site, the theoretically achievable yield can be properly approximated and thus shorter time periods can also be considered. The performance ratio can also be used to compare investments operating in different (climatic) regions or to draw conclusions about losses. Ideally, it can be even used to make statements about degradation, i.e. the reduction in hardware performance over time. However, this requires high measurement accuracy and constant comparison with the ambient conditions. At Solytic, the performance ratio is in the beta phase. It has been specially designed for in-depth analysis in order to detect hidden errors at an early stage. Display of technical string plan / digital twin Basically, it should be noted that Solytic distinguishes between a technical string plan and a digital twin. To keep comparing the features as objectively as possible however, we have adopted the principles from the pv magazine market overview. Learn about Solytic\\u2019s approach: A visualisation of the string plans enables an intuitive linking of information and the actual asset. For example, alert indications and key parameters, such as DC voltage or yield, can be pinpointed and interpreted directly at the affected system points. In this context, we differentiate between two approaches for the construction of a digital twin: a) the behavior model, calculated using learning algorithms (neural network, machine learning, artificial intelligence), as used by QOS, and b) the physical model, as used by Solytic. The first model uses actual values from the system to learn the behavior of the system under certain conditions and to evaluate it in the future. If the actual values later deviate from the calculated target values, conclusions can be drawn about possible causes. The physical model has its origin among others at NASA - in order to visualise and understand technical devices, when they are physically not accessible. In this approach, the system components with all their properties are uploaded into a digital model and their measured values are correlated. This allows to remotely determine and evaluate the exact condition of the entire system. The physical digital twin also allows that scenarios can be simulated, in the case of photovoltaics e.g. the replacement of an inverter as well as the resulting effect on the yield. Currently the data is also brought into a context in order to learn the dynamic behavior of systems and to be able to evaluate them with foresight. Control room view The control room view provides the user with an overview of KPIs and error messages for efficient monitoring of asset portfolios. Have a look at Solytic\\u2019s control room: Solytic splits this data view into a direct portfolio benchmark and a qualitative view for quick error identification with localisation. This view contains the most important information an O&M professional needs to identify a need for action. In the directly linked Portfolio Management-feature, device and system errors as well as the most important portfolio key figures are also displayed, more on this below. Portfolio management Detailed monitoring is often not necessary for residential-sized assets or it simply does not pay off. Further, utility-sized assets must be monitored so precisely that portfolio views and functions play a rather subordinate role. However, this is not the case in the commercial and industrial segment, where a large number of assets often have to be monitored as efficiently as possible. That's the bottom line. It is not enough to be able to manage a large number of assets in the portal. Rather, it is about creating conditions for O&M professionals and Asset Managers that enable them to manage a portfolio as efficiently as possible. Solytic does it this way: Various portfolio views are offered in Solytic. While monitoring solutions are usually based on the classic tree structure, Solytic can save work steps and monitor all (or selected) devices at portfolio level, not just plants. For example, the user can display an overview of all inverters of the entire portfolio, filter them by \\\"problem cases\\\" and compare them. With views like these, many work processes can be handled efficiently with Solytic. Diagrams comparable across assets Comparing different assets makes it possible to show performance deviations and system weaknesses that would hardly be visible individually. This needs to be carefully done though, as there are multiple factors influencing the measured values such as DC voltage or AC yield. Taking into account all system parameters also helps along relating values that are supposedly unique to the asset. This is how Solytic does it: The Solytic software normalizes the asset values, taking into account various asset-specific parameters and characteristics, e.g. the string plan, the geoposition and the alignment of the modules. In this way, among other things, the power and yield can be compared device-specifically. Is the software manufacturer-independent? Seven out of nine solutions can be applied without additional hardware (Solytic, Gantner.webportal, powerdoo, VCOM by meteocontrol, Ensight by Envision, SynaptiQ by 3E and Quantum Renewable Cloud by QOS). Two solutions depend on hardware, which means according to the manufacturer a corresponding data logger must be used (Solar-Log WEB Enerest\\u2122, Sunny Portal from SMA). But which solution is the right one for the respective application? Which solution is the right one for the respective application has to be clarified in detail. When switching a larger portfolio, it is easier and more cost-effective to consider a solution that doesn\\u2019t require additional hardware costs. Make the right decision for your company. In general, we encourage everyone to test all viable solutions to ensure they make the right decision. Same applies for Solytics.

Schenker | The Innovator newsSign inNews in contextDeep divesStartups to watchEvent newsInterviewsFree Newsletter SignupHow A New Data Platform Business Could Energize A 110-Year-Old Electric UtilityJennifer L. SchenkerFollowJul 29, 2019 \\u00b7 5 min readLike other energy companies, Sweden\\u2019s Vattenfall, one of Europe\\u2019s largest producers of electricity and heat, is grappling with smaller margins, increased competition and adapting an asset-heavy business to an increasingly data-centric, service-driven world.\\u201cWe saw how digitalization was changing other industries intensely and didn\\u2019t have a clue how it would effect energy markets in the future,\\u201d says Juliane Schulze, who heads up business development for renewable energy assets at the utility, which sells electricity, heat, gas and energy services to around 14 million customers in Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, Denmark and the U.K.Eager to create new revenue streams, the utility set up a new firm from scratch in 2017 and enticed outsiders to run it. Today, that company, Berlin-based Solytic, is running a vendor-independent solar analytics platform with the aim of cutting the cost of operating photovoltaic panels for business customers such as maintenance companies servicing factories, small and medium sized businesses, and farms. The company\\u2019s technology \\u2014 which includes artificial intelligence and Internet of Things hardware \\u2014 replaces manual monitoring systems. It is able to tell businesses in real-time that one or more of its photovoltaic (PV) power plants is only operating at a fraction of full-capacity, that this is abnormal based on the data collected from similar installations, and make a recommendation.Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that installed solar capacity will increase 14-fold worldwide by 2040. This is expected to lead to a growing demand for tools that help optimize return on investment. Solytic\\u2019s own market research estimates that around 25% of all solar-PV installations are underperforming.But that is just the start. The plan is to evolve the service to a multi-sector platform business model that will not only leverage the vast amounts of data it collects from solar installations but also add in other sectors, such as insurance and financial services.\\u201cSolytic\\u2019s ability to aggregate millions of data points across hundreds of thousands of solar energy assets will ultimately not only make these assets more efficient for their owners but lay the groundwork for a decentralized, large-scale trading platform that our future digital energy economy needs,\\u201d says Michael Stephanblome, a co-founder of Factor10, an independent corporate company builder that helped Vattenfall build Solytic.Moving From A 10X Factor On Margins To 100X Or MoreAlthough Vattenfall\\u2019s wind and solar renewal energy businesses are relatively young, the division had already grown to over 500 people by 2016 \\u2014 about 80% of them engineers \\u2014 and had established structures and processes that made it difficult to be entrepreneurial and agile, says Schulze.\\u201cWe wanted to understand what the energy market looks like from the perspective of entrepreneurs, to know how they see the world through their digital glasses, to look at what we could learn from business models from totally different industries and how we could transform from being asset driven to being data driven,\\u201d she says.To that end, Schulze started speaking to members of the Berlin startup community and eventually connected with Factor10, a member of the World Economic Forum\\u2019s Digital Platforms & Ecosystems working group, which focuses on how to best apply the platform business model to traditional industries. Factor10\\u2019s team is comprised of over 100 tech entrepreneurs and industry experts with a long track record in the European startup and digital ecosystem. It partners with big corporations and helps them create new digital ventures and adopt the powerful platform business models that the world\\u2019s largest Internet companies have used to grow exponentially. (Other clients include Adidas and Allianz.)Brainstorming with Factor10 led to the idea of creating a solar monitoring and analytics product that has the potential to grow into a platform business. In July of 2017 Factor10 recruited Johannes Burgard, an engineer and project manager with five years experience working at Airbus and other companies. Initially hired as an entrepreneur-in-residence at Factor10, Burgard began creating a minimally viable product (MVP) with the tech team at Factor10 and Alwin Nagel, a Vattenfall employee who left the parent company to work on the project full-time. Solytic was established as a separate legal entity in the summer of 2017. The young company hit all of its milestones, leading Vattenfall to invest \\u20ac3 million at the end of 2017. Solytic is run by Burgard, Nagel and Konrad Per\\u00e9nyi, an entrepreneur with 11 years of experience working for digital ventures such as Rocket Internet. Shareholding is split among Vattenfall, Factor10 and the three founders.\\u201cChanging a big company is like turning around a tanker,\\u201d says Burgard. \\u201cBut we can be agile and move fast.\\u201dIn addition to an innovative company structure \\u201cSolytic has the ability to really leverage the data that they show to their customers,\\u201d says Schulze. \\u201cThe data science layer is very under-developed in this industry. They have strong partnerships and a strong tech team in place that is able to analyze the root causes for failures. This is a completely new market segment in Europe.\\u201dBy automating and improving on today\\u2019s manual monitoring of industrial PV installations Solytic can, among other things, lower risks for banks and insurance companies, says Burgard. \\u201cThe whole idea of providing knowledge and creating more transparency for every single party that is involved in the community is far more interesting,\\u201d he says. \\u201cBy interlinking service providers with the owners of solar assets we can move from a 10X factor on margins to 100X or more. Tapping into this market will lead to exponential growth. That is where the magic happens.\\u201dVattenfall says it believes in that vision. \\u201cOnce you have cracked the software-as-a-service analytics nut and you have a substantial customer base and you have enough data, you can start to provide a lot of interesting services to clients that are adjacent to the energy market,\\u201d says Schulze. \\u201cFor example, grid operators need detailed data about fluctuations in renewable energy sources. This is very hard to predict. If you can develop data science for weather \\u2014 as one example \\u2014 and the analytics are developed well enough you can grab a substantial share of that market. Car-sharing companies may want to use time-sharing cars when prices are cheap because solar production is cheap. That could be a very nice service for this kind of customer group. And if you are able to provide information about the performance of assets to insurance companies or banks that help them judge their risks that could also be a valuable service. There is the possibility with this platform to create a whole ecosystem of services based on data.\\u201dJ.L.S.This article originally appeared in The Innovator\\u2019s January 2019 Davos issue.The Innovator newsConnecting Business with TechnologyFollow11 EnergyBusiness Model InnovationPlatform EconomyDeepdive11 claps11 clapsWritten byJennifer L.

We started off with coal, gas, nuclear and now into renewables. I lead our distributed generation and renewable generation research services. I\\u2019m happy to discuss some of our thought papers. A very warm welcome to our colleagues from Baywa \\u2013 Virgil is probably online \\u2013 and then we have Inaccess, Isotrol\\u2026 I would request our panel members to please introduce themselves. May I have G\\u00fcnter? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): My name is G\\u00fcnter Maier. I\\u2019m from Alteso because there are some changes on the panel and Alteso is a data analytics company for photovoltaic power plants. Daniel Watson (Isotrol): Hello, my name is Daniel Ramirez Watson. I work for Isotrol and we\\u2019re a SCADA monitoring company with more than 38 GW of renewable energy being monitored by our system. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thanks, Daniel. Daniel Watson (Isotrol): Thank you. Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Hello, my name is Johannes Burgard. I\\u2019m managing director of Solytic. We do hardware-independent monitoring and build a marketplace for decentralised assets. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Hello Johannes. Great to have you here. And we also have Virgil joining online. Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for having me. I\\u2019m Virgil Cazacu. I\\u2019m leading the digital transformation within Baywa r.e., the service side and we are one of the largest O&M providers in Europe and solar was more than 8 GW under management. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Welcome, Virgil. So, kicking off with a stat here, because we are a research company. We estimate that the monitoring and control market for both solar and wind is going to cross 80 billion dollars in revenues cumulatively over the next 10 years. That\\u2019s a massive number and of course as we all know PV is going to play the biggest role as far as just digitization is concerned. So, with that number in mind how\\u2026 Let me start over, Johannes probably with you. How would you say digitization and data or the role of digitization and data will play out in the next five or ten years from now? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): In general, I think we had yesterday already in the discussion. When we look at digitization in general, when we look at PV, we see an enormous evolvement over the last years. 10 years ago we were already adding value if you showed data. If you actually show the information on your screen and you\\u2019re not you\\u2019re not relying on going on-site and analyzing everything on site but you could do it remotely. This, of course, is already adding a lot of value now and we\\u2019re moving forward. The digital technologies, in general, are moving very fast. We are now moving into decentralized innovation so we find a lot of potential to the left, to the right and especially in other industries. So I think it is very crucial for PV that we do not just focus on our own stuff in PV. But as we just had in the presentation, we have to look into different technologies into different sectors to really leverage the technological evolvement over the last years. Also in the next years, that we can really make advancements here. So I believe that looking into different sectors, looking into different industries, leveraging the inventions of other spaces will help us to really move forward. I see a lot of potential in the automation in the analysis. We have a lot of companies now working very heavily on A.I. This is something that of course always relies on the data quality that you have and the granularity. So we need to invest in hardware. We need to invest in the first level of technology so that we can actually build new features and advance in this space. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Great, thank you, Johannes. G\\u00fcnter. The role of data: How would you qualify that? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): Well, what we hear from our customers and from big players in Europe, in India is that they would like to have solutions, where the experts in the companies, the analysts, can rely already on a result coming from analytics for the purpose that they can then focus on the more sophisticated things and the actions they should take out of that. We hear from big players in Europe that they are spending most of their time with maybe the 10% to 20% problem sites and plants and the 80% of standard plants remain kind of unanalysed and unsupervised. And also we hear, that people are just expecting, that when the team is starting in the morning, there is already a list of up-to-date analytics results that it really can focus on. And I think it is not about, in this case, reducing teams or replacing people by technology. It is rather empowering people by technology that they can focus on things where maybe just people can focus on. And I think it is just\\u2026 I would expect that the future is bringing tools, which are like weapons for the people in that sense \\u2013 in the positive way \\u2013 where they can just use this equipment for doing their work more efficiently. We also get requests from customers that say: \\u201cI would like to have a toolbox where I just would like to select when I need an analytics tool.\\u201d It\\u2019s a bit of analytics on demand. So that you do not even subscribe for something on a permanent basis, you just choose whatever you want, when you need it. So I think this all will go much more lively and much more specific for the specific need. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Excellent. That is the new gold, right? Daniel let\\u2019s hear from you. Daniel Watson (Isotrol): We believe that digitalization is going to be key in PV like we were just talking about in wind. We\\u2019ve got to gather all that knowledge and bring it into the PV sector. We have to take into account the drop of costs that we\\u2019re having throughout the PV industry. Digitalization has to aid and help in this cost reduction. And we also have to take into account the human error that we always have. Digitalization has to help customers to be able to minimize this human error, that we all might have and improve our assets. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Excellent. I\\u2019m slightly different take from you, Virgil. How would you say the needs of customers have changed \\u2013 you being an O&M provider \\u2013 with regard to the role of data? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): I think the needs of the customers also evolved with the evolvement of the technologies. As now you can get more descriptive and predictive approaches in terms of the data and making sense of the data. And then customers are expecting to see more into the future than in the past as it happened a few years ago. So just creating reports about the past months or past year is by far not enough in the current set up. The data and especially the context around the data. Because you can look up into the data, you can find some issues, for example, in some strings. But without context actually you can not get the right decisions and at the end of the day helping the customers getting efficiency into the plants. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Now that\\u2019s a really excellent point. So the context of data is critical here. Any other challenges you would like to highlight when it comes to generating efficient data? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): So I think the operations teams make decisions based on the data that they received from different data sources: from monitoring providers, SCADA systems, data loggers, inverters, satellite irradiations, weather forecast service, financial systems. So there are lots of data streams, which are now coming into play and actually from our point of view digitalization is not just a specific technology but actually it\\u2019s context and it\\u2019s an ecosystem which brings together also the business processes, also the change management teams of people. Because even if you have the best A.I., it has to be proved in the context. And also it\\u2019s a human factor involved, where especially the engineers which are working in this area, they need to gain trust that relies on that data, which is coming out from a machine learning algorithm. That this can be trusted and is scalable. across the whole portfolio. So the quality of data is super important because that has an impact on the whole chain, which follows that data ingestion. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thank you, Virgil. Johannes is coming to you. Your experience with generating efficient data and some of the challenges you would like to share with us? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): It\\u2019s more collecting. We don\\u2019t generate so we are focused on software but what we have to handle there is quite a diverse field off of data. In our case, we focus on decentralized assets and that means that we are collecting data through email, through FTP pushes, through CSV files and also through VPN or whatever so it\\u2019s a very diverse field of data and that\\u2019s definitely not efficient. But that\\u2019s basically the problem that we are trying to solve. Providing one monitoring solution that combines all these things and that\\u2019s I think it\\u2019s something that we have to tackle. So the lack of standards and the lack of unification of all these protocols is just something that is definitely hindering us in moving forward fast because it\\u2019s impossible right now to buy a plug and play product off the shelf. Simply because it doesn\\u2019t exist, because it\\u2019s not possible to build it. So there\\u2019s a lot of potential to really get closer together and build standards so that we move towards efficient data, so we can really leverage all the intelligence that we have to the left and to the right. And then we can move forward there. Right now we are quite some distance away from that. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): And how does this relate to the needs of your customer changing? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Well, as mentioned before, it used to be already adding value, if you can show the data on your desktop. But that\\u2019s a long time ago now and now the customer demands they increase. Everybody wants very smart alarms because nobody wants this flood of alarms. Using static parameters for those alarms, for instance, is something that is very useful for large scale assets, but it\\u2019s impossible to adjust these for small scale. I think we heard it yesterday as well, about 50% of the assets and the capacity is actually in residential. So who\\u2019s taking care of these people. They usually are not engineers like us. They don\\u2019t want to take care of their asset. They want someone to tell them when they have to act. Here it\\u2019s very important that we move into that direction that we can help people without technical experience, without the background to still handle PV. Because then it becomes scalable and in the big scale. Then we can actually get renewables really going. Because compared to all the other energy resources that we are using today, PV is still very small. Those are the needs that we experience. That people don\\u2019t want to bother with the assets. They want it lean, efficient and there everybody is on the same page. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Especially in the distributed energy sector. G\\u00fcnter, your take on the issues and challenges of generating efficient data. G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): In our case, it\\u2019s also not generating data, but it does not matter. We have to focus on extracting data for letting the data flow into our engine. What we see is, first of all, a big variety of quality of data worldwide. But it is also worth to say that we see a lot of issues, where data is missing, unreliable, frozen data. Very often also data are basically there, but the matching in the monitoring is simply wrong. So you\\u2019re measuring things where you\\u2019ll get the results but you are measuring from the wrong equipment part because it\\u2019s just differently defined in the monitoring system. We see our role here in the way where we\\u2019re getting this data sanitized. A lot of customers, which maybe are big and which have acquired a variety of projects, they cannot really choose what monitoring system is behind. Sometimes there is almost no monitoring behind. Sometimes there\\u2019s monitoring behind, but this is so diverse. And these customers, they tell us: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to tell us, that we have a mess. We want you to overcome this mess.\\u201d This is why a lot of the work we are doing, is some work which is not necessarily seen because it is kind of working with the data until you have a data set where you say: \\u201cNow I can start to analyze.\\u201d And I believe this will still go on for quite a while because it cannot change or overnight. I believe this is also why we say: \\u201cAutomation, A.I., M.L. \\u2013 these are all very powerful things, which are coming.\\u201d But at the moment, honestly, we are working on getting the data right for getting analysis and valuable conclusions for the client. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure, technology enablers. Yes, of course, we need an A.I. and\\u2026 G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): Sorry, maybe one last sentence. Very often on the owner\\u2019s side or customer side, they are not aware, what is their data situation until we start with the work and can visualise, how much data are missing. Just an example: We did just a tracker optimization analysis for a plant and at the end, it was revealed that 80% of the tracker position data were missing. So you can not even do an analysis or optimization. But the first information is that we can at least equip the client with the information, that you can then go to his equipment supplier and monitoring system supplier and say: \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Isotrol perspective, Daniel? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): I think this is one of the main topics and I\\u2019m glad it comes up. Because poor data, bad quality data \\u2013 it\\u2019s a big problem in the industry. Therefore it\\u2019s mandatory to have data quality and data cleansing algorithms that help customers with this problem. And the lack of sensoring, it\\u2019s also a big problem in the industry. So we\\u2019d like to advise customers early in the game about what type of sensors they need to have and how they can monitor their assets correctly. Then the other big problem that we see is that a lot of PV farms don\\u2019t have real-time monitoring. So the data acquisition for that is pretty poor. So we highly recommend our customers to have real-time data being gathered, not every 15 minutes like a lot of PV plants are being done right now. So definitely real-time robust algorithms with data quality and cleansing and having a robust system and that acquisition and censoring throughout your PV farm. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thank you, Daniel. So Virgil, coming back to you. You know just taking what Daniel just mentioned: Having these diverse set of quality and quantity of the way data is generated. How would you then apply it to OPEX? Or do you have some case studies to share, where you\\u2019ve seen a real cost reduction when it comes to your OPEX? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): Just to underline one thing. Indeed we are talking about very advanced systems like machine learning, A.I. The reality is that we need to focus on reflecting what we are currently doing. That means perfecting performance ratios, the availabilities in order to meet these objectives and at the end of the day the financial returns for each asset. Having said that and related to the OPEX impact of digital tools, I can give you two examples from our side. One is the optimizations of the plants\\u2019 on-site related activities, which is actually technicians. They go on-site and they perform the necessary work to the PV plants which relates also to having better customer satisfaction. Because it\\u2019s a difference when someone goes on-site with some paper and pen and they do their work or they go with a digital solution, where they can capture all the findings and all the work. For example, for maintenance plants to capture all the necessary documentation and centralize it and then creating reports for different stakeholders in different formats more automatically, that definitely has an impact on the structures and on the OPEX. And zooming out from the plant to the monitoring part, improved decision making based on data analytics. That\\u2019s where we are focusing because we want to have a decrease of production cost to more focused, less operations, where the cleaning or the inspections can be done more focused on the pain points of the plants. So instead of just going for big plants just going and driving hectares and checking with drones all plants then we can, based on the data, have targeted inspections. That can bring optimization also in terms of spare parts management. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thanks, Virgil. Johannes, would you like to share some ideas of how it\\u2019s impacted the OPEX of your customers? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Well, it\\u2019s the point I made earlier. The combination of different monitoring solutions, the different data sources that we\\u2019re just combining, so our customers are using one monitoring instead of 15, which is something that is very common probably to everyone who is monitoring a couple of hundred megawatts or even in the gigawatt space. Those companies do it themselves. Of course and that\\u2019s good. So it\\u2019s not a new idea. It\\u2019s just something if you\\u2019re just a craftsman and you\\u2019re handling 500 assets and they\\u2019re all very small, you don\\u2019t have access to this technology that you build it yourself. So this obviously helps a lot in becoming more efficient on a daily basis. Something that we are working on together with customers right now is to take the next step. If you identify some default or some anomaly, how do you solve it? So going towards preventive maintenance is the standard, mostly correct of maintenance in the residential space, but then when we want to move towards prescriptive maintenance, so predictive for something we can\\u2019t do ourselves. So we are looking for partners there. But I think this is something that is very interesting in the future. To provide solutions and not just the information that something is wrong. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): And that\\u2019s again a really interesting point. So when you look at predictive maintenance versus prescriptive like you mentioned: What is the incremental cost to your customer? How do they really measure it? Do they look at it in terms of cost reductions or revenue targets? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): They don\\u2019t yet. And we don\\u2019t have it. It\\u2019s not that we\\u2019ve found the special sauce to create it, yet. For us really the use case right now is providing one monitoring solution instead of 15 and that is reducing a lot of complexity in the day to day business. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure. We\\u2019ll come back to integration. I think it\\u2019s a really pertinent topic in this industry. G\\u00fcnter, what\\u2019s your experience with OPEX and digitization? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): Concerning this topic, we have case studies which are coming from the analytics of course because this is our business. And in 2018 we did a white paper which is called \\u201cOPEX reduction coming from analytics\\u201d. Everybody can download this from our webpage. But to cut the long story short, we have described three different categories. One category was about the minimization and the reduction of any kind of physical inspection. So that you need not to spend so much time physically inspect something in order to find the issue. You know already the issue when for example you go either to the site or just to the specific stream. So you do not have to search or to test or to measure first in a quite time-consuming way. You know already where to go and you know already where to fix. On that the reduction of time, which is then of course also a bit of an equivalent in cost, is when an O&M is on-site anyway, then a reduction is possible by about 90%. Because instead of searching for it, they just focus on what they should mitigate repair. And they have done also the verification immediately available. When they do something they see if it was successful. And the customer sees it as well, which is important because it was they\\u2019re not you know a useless standard O&M activity at the site. You know already if there was a success. When the O&M team is not at the site, when it\\u2019s an external provider, then you can reduce or improve the efficiency of this time for a week for example for a site campaign, where the O&M team is spending on site. Instead of five days, for example, you reduce these to free days because you can just save on some time on the things. I\\u2019m just repeating myself here. The other two categories where one example was on soiling. When you know that in the 35% of the plant the soiling rate is for example in lost terms 5%, you could focus on these 35% first or only. And this is then improving in a higher leverage the performance of the plant, let\\u2019s maybe say up 1-2%. You\\u2019re reducing quickly 50% of your soiling losses and you\\u2019re spending also cleaning by 60%. The last category was the spare part management. When you know better for this site what is specifically necessary for that site by experience from analyzing the plant, then you can dedicate better the spare parts, which is there at stock. If this is combined with the asset management system, which has already maybe a spare part inventory, then this can be structured very efficiently. On the question you had before about comparison of preventive to predictive or prescriptive maintenance: I think we have also not lost numbers but I think it is quite easy when you say instead of doing an activity every year \\u2013 standard \\u2013 you basically extend these two maybe every two years, every three years. Then everybody can calculate, what it can be in terms. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Great point, G\\u00fcnter. I think obviously supply chain and minimizing cost across your supply chain as it is integrated with asset management and overall the monitoring system, I think it does have a very natural progression and that\\u2019s how I think holistically it should be looked at. So that\\u2019s a great point. Daniel, would you have some case studies to share? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): Yes, for sure. Very good points brought up so far. We think that improving is our duty and a reduction of O&M cost is part of it. So definitely there\\u2019s a lot of customers that are spending a huge amount of hours in the offices, trying to figure out what\\u2019s going on with their assets. We need to reduce those hours drastically. Then the other point we need to support the people that are working out in the field. There\\u2019s a lot of trackers that are not being monitored. There\\u2019s a lot of strings that are not being monitored. There\\u2019s a lot of soiling problems. There\\u2019s a lot of shading problems. There\\u2019s different a performance sense within the same solar farms that need to be monitored and we need to put the focus on the spotlight on all these problems so we save a lot of time for field personnel. And then the other item is having a strong CMMS system to be able to have your like you were mentioning your inventory under control, your people under control, your consumables, your spare parts, everything. And a lot of companies are doing this in-house so you can have everything under control. But a lot of companies are also outsourcing this. So by knowing when you have to do these actions you could also say: \\u201cOK. Maybe it\\u2019s cheaper to do it at this point in time of the year because the market is not so busy at the moment.\\u201d So all of these items that we mentioned, have to be taken into account. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Great, excellent point. When data aggregation is another contentious issues and it does come up as a key enabler in drawing the best out of your data. So Virgil, how do you view data aggregation or basically consolidating data across your portfolio of assets and what are the benefits you can reap out of it? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): Yes, that\\u2019s a great question and this may sound easy to be done, but actually is quite challenging from an O&M perspective. Centralizing the production data, the past, the importing, project spending, the stakeholder management in one place. It\\u2019s a very complex work, especially when you are also in an international environment. But the benefits which this in return \\u2013 and again, it sometimes a tedious work to do it \\u2013 is actually great, because you can have as we put this 360-degree view of the assets under management and you can see in one place, in one platform, an asset management platform, you can see all the events which relate to certain assets. And again for us, events are not just the monitoring events and the alarms, but also all the communication with the customers or the reports which were created, all the financials around that system. And that\\u2019s actually because we were talking previously about the context that actually gives context to all the data points, which can be very diverse as you can see. It gives sense and you can actually then think about how you can offer added value services to the customers. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Excellent. Johannes, this is probably something that you deal with on a regular basis, because your focus is on the distributed energy area. And I know you touched upon this, but dealing with aggregation of data across a portfolio, whether it\\u2019s a microgrid or whether it\\u2019s your C&I customers, what has been your biggest challenge in terms of consolidation? And would you share an example of how you go about solving an issue like that? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Well, we\\u2019re still working on it, but, it\\u2019s still a challenge. And with new customers there come new challenges. So I don\\u2019t think that we do something special there or that we are different from all the other big players because this is something everybody has to deal with. So if you have different data gateways or data loggers in place. Whether you have string, trackers or combiner boxes or whatever data you\\u2019re connecting, you always have the challenge to bring this to a level that you can analyze it. As mentioned before, getting cleaned data in the first place to properly analyze it is the biggest challenge. This is kind of our core that we process the data in the way that we can actually then visualize it in one way. But I don\\u2019t think that we struggle there with things that not everybody, who does it, has experienced. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): And is there a particular kind of customer group who are more interested in aggregated data? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Well, those who want to work with it. So those who prefer to work professionally with it. Of course, they are looking into the next potential. Whatever you developed last year is now status quo and you have to evolve. You have to move forward. But there are still a lot of installers, small scale installers and small scale EPCs, that are just learning. They are starting now to experience PV. I guess at the end of the day the more professional you are, the higher your standards. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thank you. G\\u00fcnter, OPEX and data aggregation. Do you have some thoughts to share? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): We standing here a bit on the sideline, but just on the question you also had before about if there is a specific group of customers. Well, I think it is specifically those customers which have large diverse portfolios. For example, customers which are in a very aggressive acquisition mode, which are looking for underperforming assets. Then they have very diverse assets in size. Also, the local monitoring systems are always different. So it\\u2019s a big challenge to harmonize all those sets because you have also different starting conditions. I mean Humberto just came in. I think he could probably speak about two hours about that topic. He is here the better person to speak. But what I wanted to say is about OPEX: The harmonization and the consolidation are bringing a bit of an addition on OPEX because you will also pay for this, let\\u2019s say central monitoring or asset management system. On the other hand, I think it is clearly reducing the confusion within the company. Because what we all often hear is that people say: \\u201cI have two, three different sets of data and they do not know what is right and how it is correlating.\\u201d And I think this is a big task, bringing this together so that you have one data set where you think you can rely on. I believe the costs of confusion in the company is hard to quantify. You see just what you are paying, but you are not seeing clearly what you\\u2019re then saving. Because unproductive time is a bit difficult to count. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure. Daniel? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): Like we were mentioning, data consolidation and aggregation is key, especially with the very large customers that are joining the industry, adding gigawatts of PV per year. So definitely each customer needs to have a solution that is catered for them. Are utilities going to ask for something different compared to an investor for example? But definitely data aggregation platforms are key and they\\u2019re going to have a huge role in these years coming, what we\\u2019re looking forward to right now. And one of the other main items to mention about this topic is, what we were talking before and we also mentioned: The quality of the data that we receive for these platforms is key. You won\\u2019t be able to work properly with them if you don\\u2019t have it. And so is saving decision-making time for people working with these assets. Having gigawatts of renewable energy, PV, in your system, you need to have these data aggregation systems in place, so it can work efficiently. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure. I mean, scale, like all of you mentioned, is one of the key enablers for ensuring that you aggregate your data. But we also spoke to a few asset managers who say that having different assets and different geographies of the world has also created a lot of issue of data aggregation. So this asset manager that I spoke to had massive GW capacity in Europe and in APAC, and they wanted to put that all on the same dashboards. But they were coming from different O&M companies. So there you go. We need, we need a standardized data aggregation consolidation tool. So that brings us to this very interesting topic of models. Would you shed some light on how it\\u2019s done \\u2013 Insourcing vs. outsourcing? And why have you chosen to do it a particular way? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): That\\u2019s not a straight forward answer because it depends on what type of activities you want to perform. Our way of working in Baywa is that we do certain activities in-house. Also, we believe that we have lots of knowledge and we have lots of digital tools that we develop based on this knowledge. Always having also an outside influx of ideas and maybe different ways of even the same things that we are doing, had us to iterate and go forward with new services that also the customers are expecting. And now in terms of if there is a real split of digital services, we are working with startups. So our mostly as our VC arm that we have, we work with different startups to also understand and make sense of what type of digital services can be used and actually can bring value. Because it\\u2019s a lot of also buzzwords out there and, also a lot of smoke in terms of what all these buzzwords can bring. And actually, when you put them at work you see that it\\u2019s maybe not valuable to the customer or what he is willing to pay. But I think a balance at this moment is difficult to clearly define. Doing all the big data in house, because also there are all the constraints from a contextual point of view. Also, there are all the regulations from each country, which have to be taken into account. And then, of course, the complexity. It\\u2019s growing by each portfolio that you are managing. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure. So Johannes, with your customers, how have you seen this model change? If they were doing it in-house earlier and now they have reached out? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): This insourcing/outsourcing topic is from my perspective more a question regarding focus. So what Virgil was just pointing towards: You have to think about what\\u2019s your focus, what\\u2019s your strength, what is supposed to be a strength. And data aggregation for sure is something you can work full time on. And if that\\u2019s for instance not supposed to be your focus or your strong point in the market, you shouldn\\u2019t do it. But if you have the size like Baywa, I guess that\\u2019s the point where it becomes also a key strength. So it does make sense to take this in. Our customers, of course mostly small, there are many which tried to do the entire thing themselves for a very long time. And now they approach us because they don\\u2019t want to try everything at the same time. The market is evolving. CAPEX is going down, OPEX is rather rising. But the importance of OPEX is becoming more important. If you\\u2019re an O&M, you have to manage this. You cannot do everything at the same time. So if your focus is clear, it\\u2019s very a straight forward decision whether you want to insource or outsource a certain task. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): G\\u00fcnter, your take on doing it themselves and outsourcing? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): As we have heard yesterday, there is not one best practice fitting all. But I think there are some rules and one thing is that, when it comes to monitoring systems and monitoring data, I believe a rule should be that the owner owns the monitoring system and the data and not the O&M or somebody else because data has a value. And this value of data is increasing. There are some people in the industry which when they are developing energy management systems, they say: \\u201cThe data and the knowledge for when the kWh is produced, is maybe higher than the kWh produced one day.\\u201d On analytics, outsourcing/insourcing: We believe that one of the best solutions for large companies is that they are using highly developed analytics platforms because this is what we are selling. But I believe it is also advisable that they have expert teams in house, which have the core knowledge of the performance and analytics. This is for the big players. I think for the small players or niche players which have maybe just a finance team, there may be a doable solution is that you use an analytic system, but also the analytics provider is adding a team as technical advisors, so that you get the support as well, not just using the product. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Daniel? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): For us at the end being done in-house or outsourcing it, is not that big of a deal. The importance at the end is to support the company, to support your customer and be able to cater to their needs. There are companies that are growing so fast that they can interiorize all these systems or things that they would like to do. And we like to bring to the table the knowledge that we\\u2019ve acquired for working with so many customers, to be able to guide customers and learn from them also. So working in-house or out-house, it depends on the company and how it works for them. Definitely, we would like to give this opportunity to customers to learn from us and to be able to start internalizing some of the services that we provide. So we\\u2019re open to both solutions. At the end, doing it right, having good quality data and producing good reports, good KPIs, good analytics that help put the focus on where the problems are coming from, is more important than just thinking: \\u201cShould we do it in-house or out-house?\\u201d Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure, leveraging best practices, right? And that brings us back to how Daniel started this session today. Would you, Daniel, also share, how you see some of the best practices that can be leveraged from the wind digitization journey? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): I think, we would all agree that wind is a step ahead of PV. Like we were talking before like we\\u2019ve talked in so many sessions: We need to bring that sensoring that we have in wind into PV. When you go and buy a wind turbine in Dubai from Vestas everything is included: for example, Siemens, whomever, your switch gear, your gearbox, your generator, everything is interlinked and it behaves like one system. In PV that doesn\\u2019t happen. We need to bring suppliers into working together much earlier. So right now we have like 50 systems that are working independently, one from each other. So we need to bring this to the table. For wind, we\\u2019ve gone a step ahead and there\\u2019s a lot of predictive maintenance that is being already done. Machines diagnose themselves, know when something is going wrong when they need to stop when they need to restart. In PV we\\u2019re still figuring out what\\u2019s happening in our field because of the lack of sensoring, the lack of good quality data, the lack of knowing what\\u2019s going on. So definitely we need to bring all the experience and the come together and work together that was done in wind and bring it over on to PV. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): I\\u2019m coming back to Baywa, Virgil. I think you would probably have a couple of comments to make on how we can share best practices from wind to solar? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): Monitoring both technologies and doing the management, technical and commercial management, we have the luxury to exchange internally the experience. Because it\\u2019s a digital panel I would maybe stop to one example that\\u2019s again about buzzwords: A.I. and machine learning. They started a bit earlier in terms of developing self-services around the sensors from the turbines. I think what we can learn from there is that even the data which is collected from a turbine, which has hundreds of sensors, you want to do predictive maintenance on different components, a gearbox, IT systems and so on. And even if you have a lot of data coming from these sensors the results, which machine learning A.I. can bring, can be very skewed by the context. It\\u2019s always based on how you train the data sets by the experts from that wind industry. And now projecting to the PV side, where you have far less sensors and even the ones you have them on-site, most of the time they are decalibrated or sending the wrong data, it makes this even more complicated. All these future systems and algorithms which will give the success that we are looking for by standardization across components of the plants and the better integration between them will help us. That\\u2019s one of the lessons that we have learned. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thank you, Virgil. Johannes, any thoughts to share on how we can leverage wind digitization? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): I\\u2019ve been sailing twice, but my experience in wind is very limited, to be honest. I think also the time is up. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Can we have one last comment from G\\u00fcnter, if that\\u2019s okay? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): On this topic or on any topic or on this wind topic you mean? Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): No, on best practices or anything else, if you would like to add something. G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): Best practices I see in a way that \\u2013 I repeat just what I think the gentleman from Wood Mackenzie first said \\u2013 in order to move forward, it is important that all stakeholders are kind of having the interest to work together. That sounds always a bit boring, but I think here it is very much true because the value of data and insights exists only when it is used. It doesn\\u2019t matter when one stakeholder has data and insights, but other stakeholders have no access to it. Then nobody can benefit from progressing. We are trying to work together with other companies. For example, I\\u2019m very happy that we have a project with Above, which is a drone company, where we are trying to correlate the permanent analytics results with the information you get from drones. We believe this is a very good fit. I believe that sooner or later this is merging together anyway. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Excellent. With that, I would like to thank our amazing panel today. Do we have any questions? Okay. So please feel free to reach out to them later. And thank you all for your patience.

About a year ago, he learnt of Solytic. Previously, Kondula was long convinced that no one from outside could better display their internal IT processes, as they themselves. He changed this opinion after a test phase with Solytic for three of their PV plants. The company bos.ten is officially certified by T\\u00dcV Rheinland for the operation and maintenance of PV systems. We have repeatedly tested offerings from various monitoring providers hoping to find a solution where we could integrate and monitor all our assets from one platform. Partly a conversion of the hardware would have been necessary. However, that would have been associated with a financial overhead that we did not want our customers to bear. In turn, without retrofitting, it would have been very expensive to integrate the PV systems into the software at all. Too many different systems One potential monitoring provider worked with open interfaces and would have been able to integrate our assets. However, the cost of onboarding and implementing a sub-user structure for our customers was very high, far too high in the current market scenario. After all, all costs must be earned back by the solar asset. For us, it was very important that the colourful bouquet of PV systems with different technologies and components could be integrated into a portal without horrendous costs. That\\u2019s why we needed a hardware-independent monitoring solution. The portfolio of our operational systems alone comprises ten different inverter manufacturers, each with several different models. In addition, since the commissioning of our oldest power plant in 2003, the technical standard of solar parks has evolved considerably. Solytic was able to meet these requirements with ease and at a price that was extremely attractive compared to the other offerings available in the market. The variety of technology and integration of different component manufacturers was not the only challenge that faced bos.ten. Define users and assign earnings separately One of bos.ten\\u2019s solar parks is owned by more than 20 different investors, all of whom have to receive independent reports. So there is no classic participation model as with most other operators. This unique feature also means a higher effort. We have to be able to map this for each investor accordingly and correctly assign differentiated returns. Solytic was able to address this challenge too. The Berlin-based startup that prides itself in offering tailor-made solutions and was able to provide bos.ten with client and investor access as specifically required. After a short test phase with three assets, it became clear that the Solytic software was well suited to our requirements. The attractive price-performance ratio also played a role in our decision. Synergies through generalization Of course, having your own DIY solution also has its advantages; you can map everything just as it seems important and meaningful to your own company. For example, our clients require validated forecasting from yield assessments to finance their PV system. Accordingly, these commercial target values \\u200b\\u200bin our previous portal solution were compared with the generated earnings. These commercial values \\u200b\\u200bare irrelevant to Solytic\\u2019s technical plant monitoring. Therefore, you have to make a few small compromises with such an open solution. You have to wait for certain wishes because the focus from the viewpoint of the programmers is always on a generalization and not on a specialization. Nevertheless, our assessment was clearly in favour of Solytic. Finally, we save ourselves the time and the costs for the further development of the software. And for our sister companies, there were even greater synergies than originally expected: The partnership relationship with Solytic enables us to receive inquiries on nearly all of the bos.ten Group\\u2019s services, including plant control, PV substructures, and construction and maintenance services. An internal cost-benefit calculation made this clear to us. Because we save a lot of work every day if PV monitoring is becoming more automated. Because of this decision-making process, we have now got a good overview of the internal costs of our monitoring, uncovered potential savings and realized that the documentation of our facilities was not always as complete as we thought before. Monitoring is now much more intuitive and faster. Our employees do not need to have such a deep technical understanding of the equipment on site. As a result, the same team size can serve a much larger portfolio, and that drives our planned growth. Interface to CRM built-in A bidirectional interface between the monitoring software and our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) was particularly important to us. All tickets are managed there so that the bookkeeping and customer service have access. Solytic made it possible. We did not have to adapt our company to the software, Solytic provided a tailor-made solution. Last but not least, we also play an active role in the development of new features that add value to both sides. Advantages of a professional software solution outweigh For each decision, the pros and cons need to be weighed and that\\u2019s exactly what we did in this case. In the first step, we looked at and tested all relevant professional software solutions and compared the best of them with our in-house developed solution. In our case, we decided on Solytic, as we saw the greatest cost/benefit efficiency for us, especially in the long term. Make the right decision for your company! In gerneral we encourage everyone to test all viable solutions to make sure, that the right decision is made.

What are the challenges when it comes to generating efficient data? How are the needs of PV monitoring customers changing? How is digitization reducing costs when it comes to your OPEX? What are the benefits of data aggregation or consolidating data across portfolios of assets? What are the biggest challenges in data consolidation? Insourcing vs. outsourcing data aggregation? What are best practices that can be leveraged from the wind digitization journey? Listen to what the experts from Baywa r.e., Alteso, Isotrol and Solytic had to say: Transcript: Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Morning, everybody. My name is Pritil Gunjan and I am a senior analyst with Navigant Research, now a Guidehouse company. For those who don\\u2019t know us, we are a research and consulting firm. We\\u2019ve published reports in the energy sector. We have written various thought papers on how the industry has changed over the years. We started off with coal, gas, nuclear and now into renewables. I lead our distributed generation and renewable generation research services. I\\u2019m happy to discuss some of our thought papers. A very warm welcome to our colleagues from Baywa \\u2013 Virgil is probably online \\u2013 and then we have Inaccess, Isotrol\\u2026 I would request our panel members to please introduce themselves. May I have G\\u00fcnter? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): My name is G\\u00fcnter Maier. I\\u2019m from Alteso because there are some changes on the panel and Alteso is a data analytics company for photovoltaic power plants. Daniel Watson (Isotrol): Hello, my name is Daniel Ramirez Watson. I work for Isotrol and we\\u2019re a SCADA monitoring company with more than 38 GW of renewable energy being monitored by our system. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thanks, Daniel. Daniel Watson (Isotrol): Thank you. Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Hello, my name is Johannes Burgard. I\\u2019m managing director of Solytic. We do hardware-independent monitoring and build a marketplace for decentralised assets. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Hello Johannes. Great to have you here. And we also have Virgil joining online. Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for having me. I\\u2019m Virgil Cazacu. I\\u2019m leading the digital transformation within Baywa r.e., the service side and we are one of the largest O&M providers in Europe and solar was more than 8 GW under management. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Welcome, Virgil. So, kicking off with a stat here, because we are a research company. We estimate that the monitoring and control market for both solar and wind is going to cross 80 billion dollars in revenues cumulatively over the next 10 years. That\\u2019s a massive number and of course as we all know PV is going to play the biggest role as far as just digitization is concerned. So, with that number in mind how\\u2026 Let me start over, Johannes probably with you. How would you say digitization and data or the role of digitization and data will play out in the next five or ten years from now? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): In general, I think we had yesterday already in the discussion. When we look at digitization in general, when we look at PV, we see an enormous evolvement over the last years. 10 years ago we were already adding value if you showed data. If you actually show the information on your screen and you\\u2019re not you\\u2019re not relying on going on-site and analyzing everything on site but you could do it remotely. This, of course, is already adding a lot of value now and we\\u2019re moving forward. The digital technologies, in general, are moving very fast. We are now moving into decentralized innovation so we find a lot of potential to the left, to the right and especially in other industries. So I think it is very crucial for PV that we do not just focus on our own stuff in PV. But as we just had in the presentation, we have to look into different technologies into different sectors to really leverage the technological evolvement over the last years. Also in the next years, that we can really make advancements here. So I believe that looking into different sectors, looking into different industries, leveraging the inventions of other spaces will help us to really move forward. I see a lot of potential in the automation in the analysis. We have a lot of companies now working very heavily on A.I. This is something that of course always relies on the data quality that you have and the granularity. So we need to invest in hardware. We need to invest in the first level of technology so that we can actually build new features and advance in this space. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Great, thank you, Johannes. G\\u00fcnter. The role of data: How would you qualify that? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): Well, what we hear from our customers and from big players in Europe, in India is that they would like to have solutions, where the experts in the companies, the analysts, can rely already on a result coming from analytics for the purpose that they can then focus on the more sophisticated things and the actions they should take out of that. We hear from big players in Europe that they are spending most of their time with maybe the 10% to 20% problem sites and plants and the 80% of standard plants remain kind of unanalysed and unsupervised. And also we hear, that people are just expecting, that when the team is starting in the morning, there is already a list of up-to-date analytics results that it really can focus on. And I think it is not about, in this case, reducing teams or replacing people by technology. It is rather empowering people by technology that they can focus on things where maybe just people can focus on. And I think it is just\\u2026 I would expect that the future is bringing tools, which are like weapons for the people in that sense \\u2013 in the positive way \\u2013 where they can just use this equipment for doing their work more efficiently. We also get requests from customers that say: \\u201cI would like to have a toolbox where I just would like to select when I need an analytics tool.\\u201d It\\u2019s a bit of analytics on demand. So that you do not even subscribe for something on a permanent basis, you just choose whatever you want, when you need it. So I think this all will go much more lively and much more specific for the specific need. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Excellent. That is the new gold, right? Daniel let\\u2019s hear from you. Daniel Watson (Isotrol): We believe that digitalization is going to be key in PV like we were just talking about in wind. We\\u2019ve got to gather all that knowledge and bring it into the PV sector. We have to take into account the drop of costs that we\\u2019re having throughout the PV industry. Digitalization has to aid and help in this cost reduction. And we also have to take into account the human error that we always have. Digitalization has to help customers to be able to minimize this human error, that we all might have and improve our assets. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Excellent. I\\u2019m slightly different take from you, Virgil. How would you say the needs of customers have changed \\u2013 you being an O&M provider \\u2013 with regard to the role of data? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): I think the needs of the customers also evolved with the evolvement of the technologies. As now you can get more descriptive and predictive approaches in terms of the data and making sense of the data. And then customers are expecting to see more into the future than in the past as it happened a few years ago. So just creating reports about the past months or past year is by far not enough in the current set up. The data and especially the context around the data. Because you can look up into the data, you can find some issues, for example, in some strings. But without context actually you can not get the right decisions and at the end of the day helping the customers getting efficiency into the plants. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Now that\\u2019s a really excellent point. So the context of data is critical here. Any other challenges you would like to highlight when it comes to generating efficient data? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): So I think the operations teams make decisions based on the data that they received from different data sources: from monitoring providers, SCADA systems, data loggers, inverters, satellite irradiations, weather forecast service, financial systems. So there are lots of data streams, which are now coming into play and actually from our point of view digitalization is not just a specific technology but actually it\\u2019s context and it\\u2019s an ecosystem which brings together also the business processes, also the change management teams of people. Because even if you have the best A.I., it has to be proved in the context. And also it\\u2019s a human factor involved, where especially the engineers which are working in this area, they need to gain trust that relies on that data, which is coming out from a machine learning algorithm. That this can be trusted and is scalable. across the whole portfolio. So the quality of data is super important because that has an impact on the whole chain, which follows that data ingestion. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thank you, Virgil. Johannes is coming to you. Your experience with generating efficient data and some of the challenges you would like to share with us? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): It\\u2019s more collecting. We don\\u2019t generate so we are focused on software but what we have to handle there is quite a diverse field off of data. In our case, we focus on decentralized assets and that means that we are collecting data through email, through FTP pushes, through CSV files and also through VPN or whatever so it\\u2019s a very diverse field of data and that\\u2019s definitely not efficient. But that\\u2019s basically the problem that we are trying to solve. Providing one monitoring solution that combines all these things and that\\u2019s I think it\\u2019s something that we have to tackle. So the lack of standards and the lack of unification of all these protocols is just something that is definitely hindering us in moving forward fast because it\\u2019s impossible right now to buy a plug and play product off the shelf. Simply because it doesn\\u2019t exist, because it\\u2019s not possible to build it. So there\\u2019s a lot of potential to really get closer together and build standards so that we move towards efficient data, so we can really leverage all the intelligence that we have to the left and to the right. And then we can move forward there. Right now we are quite some distance away from that. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): And how does this relate to the needs of your customer changing? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Well, as mentioned before, it used to be already adding value, if you can show the data on your desktop. But that\\u2019s a long time ago now and now the customer demands they increase. Everybody wants very smart alarms because nobody wants this flood of alarms. Using static parameters for those alarms, for instance, is something that is very useful for large scale assets, but it\\u2019s impossible to adjust these for small scale. I think we heard it yesterday as well, about 50% of the assets and the capacity is actually in residential. So who\\u2019s taking care of these people. They usually are not engineers like us. They don\\u2019t want to take care of their asset. They want someone to tell them when they have to act. Here it\\u2019s very important that we move into that direction that we can help people without technical experience, without the background to still handle PV. Because then it becomes scalable and in the big scale. Then we can actually get renewables really going. Because compared to all the other energy resources that we are using today, PV is still very small. Those are the needs that we experience. That people don\\u2019t want to bother with the assets. They want it lean, efficient and there everybody is on the same page. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Especially in the distributed energy sector. G\\u00fcnter, your take on the issues and challenges of generating efficient data. G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): In our case, it\\u2019s also not generating data, but it does not matter. We have to focus on extracting data for letting the data flow into our engine. What we see is, first of all, a big variety of quality of data worldwide. But it is also worth to say that we see a lot of issues, where data is missing, unreliable, frozen data. Very often also data are basically there, but the matching in the monitoring is simply wrong. So you\\u2019re measuring things where you\\u2019ll get the results but you are measuring from the wrong equipment part because it\\u2019s just differently defined in the monitoring system. We see our role here in the way where we\\u2019re getting this data sanitized. A lot of customers, which maybe are big and which have acquired a variety of projects, they cannot really choose what monitoring system is behind. Sometimes there is almost no monitoring behind. Sometimes there\\u2019s monitoring behind, but this is so diverse. And these customers, they tell us: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to tell us, that we have a mess. We want you to overcome this mess.\\u201d This is why a lot of the work we are doing, is some work which is not necessarily seen because it is kind of working with the data until you have a data set where you say: \\u201cNow I can start to analyze.\\u201d And I believe this will still go on for quite a while because it cannot change or overnight. I believe this is also why we say: \\u201cAutomation, A.I., M.L. \\u2013 these are all very powerful things, which are coming.\\u201d But at the moment, honestly, we are working on getting the data right for getting analysis and valuable conclusions for the client. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure, technology enablers. Yes, of course, we need an A.I. and\\u2026 G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): Sorry, maybe one last sentence. Very often on the owner\\u2019s side or customer side, they are not aware, what is their data situation until we start with the work and can visualise, how much data are missing. Just an example: We did just a tracker optimization analysis for a plant and at the end, it was revealed that 80% of the tracker position data were missing. So you can not even do an analysis or optimization. But the first information is that we can at least equip the client with the information, that you can then go to his equipment supplier and monitoring system supplier and say: \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Isotrol perspective, Daniel? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): I think this is one of the main topics and I\\u2019m glad it comes up. Because poor data, bad quality data \\u2013 it\\u2019s a big problem in the industry. Therefore it\\u2019s mandatory to have data quality and data cleansing algorithms that help customers with this problem. And the lack of sensoring, it\\u2019s also a big problem in the industry. So we\\u2019d like to advise customers early in the game about what type of sensors they need to have and how they can monitor their assets correctly. Then the other big problem that we see is that a lot of PV farms don\\u2019t have real-time monitoring. So the data acquisition for that is pretty poor. So we highly recommend our customers to have real-time data being gathered, not every 15 minutes like a lot of PV plants are being done right now. So definitely real-time robust algorithms with data quality and cleansing and having a robust system and that acquisition and censoring throughout your PV farm. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thank you, Daniel. So Virgil, coming back to you. You know just taking what Daniel just mentioned: Having these diverse set of quality and quantity of the way data is generated. How would you then apply it to OPEX? Or do you have some case studies to share, where you\\u2019ve seen a real cost reduction when it comes to your OPEX? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): Just to underline one thing. Indeed we are talking about very advanced systems like machine learning, A.I. The reality is that we need to focus on reflecting what we are currently doing. That means perfecting performance ratios, the availabilities in order to meet these objectives and at the end of the day the financial returns for each asset. Having said that and related to the OPEX impact of digital tools, I can give you two examples from our side. One is the optimizations of the plants\\u2019 on-site related activities, which is actually technicians. They go on-site and they perform the necessary work to the PV plants which relates also to having better customer satisfaction. Because it\\u2019s a difference when someone goes on-site with some paper and pen and they do their work or they go with a digital solution, where they can capture all the findings and all the work. For example, for maintenance plants to capture all the necessary documentation and centralize it and then creating reports for different stakeholders in different formats more automatically, that definitely has an impact on the structures and on the OPEX. And zooming out from the plant to the monitoring part, improved decision making based on data analytics. That\\u2019s where we are focusing because we want to have a decrease of production cost to more focused, less operations, where the cleaning or the inspections can be done more focused on the pain points of the plants. So instead of just going for big plants just going and driving hectares and checking with drones all plants then we can, based on the data, have targeted inspections. That can bring optimization also in terms of spare parts management. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thanks, Virgil. Johannes, would you like to share some ideas of how it\\u2019s impacted the OPEX of your customers? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Well, it\\u2019s the point I made earlier. The combination of different monitoring solutions, the different data sources that we\\u2019re just combining, so our customers are using one monitoring instead of 15, which is something that is very common probably to everyone who is monitoring a couple of hundred megawatts or even in the gigawatt space. Those companies do it themselves. Of course and that\\u2019s good. So it\\u2019s not a new idea. It\\u2019s just something if you\\u2019re just a craftsman and you\\u2019re handling 500 assets and they\\u2019re all very small, you don\\u2019t have access to this technology that you build it yourself. So this obviously helps a lot in becoming more efficient on a daily basis. Something that we are working on together with customers right now is to take the next step. If you identify some default or some anomaly, how do you solve it? So going towards preventive maintenance is the standard, mostly correct of maintenance in the residential space, but then when we want to move towards prescriptive maintenance, so predictive for something we can\\u2019t do ourselves. So we are looking for partners there. But I think this is something that is very interesting in the future. To provide solutions and not just the information that something is wrong. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): And that\\u2019s again a really interesting point. So when you look at predictive maintenance versus prescriptive like you mentioned: What is the incremental cost to your customer? How do they really measure it? Do they look at it in terms of cost reductions or revenue targets? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): They don\\u2019t yet. And we don\\u2019t have it. It\\u2019s not that we\\u2019ve found the special sauce to create it, yet. For us really the use case right now is providing one monitoring solution instead of 15 and that is reducing a lot of complexity in the day to day business. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure. We\\u2019ll come back to integration. I think it\\u2019s a really pertinent topic in this industry. G\\u00fcnter, what\\u2019s your experience with OPEX and digitization? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): Concerning this topic, we have case studies which are coming from the analytics of course because this is our business. And in 2018 we did a white paper which is called \\u201cOPEX reduction coming from analytics\\u201d. Everybody can download this from our webpage. But to cut the long story short, we have described three different categories. One category was about the minimization and the reduction of any kind of physical inspection. So that you need not to spend so much time physically inspect something in order to find the issue. You know already the issue when for example you go either to the site or just to the specific stream. So you do not have to search or to test or to measure first in a quite time-consuming way. You know already where to go and you know already where to fix. On that the reduction of time, which is then of course also a bit of an equivalent in cost, is when an O&M is on-site anyway, then a reduction is possible by about 90%. Because instead of searching for it, they just focus on what they should mitigate repair. And they have done also the verification immediately available. When they do something they see if it was successful. And the customer sees it as well, which is important because it was they\\u2019re not you know a useless standard O&M activity at the site. You know already if there was a success. When the O&M team is not at the site, when it\\u2019s an external provider, then you can reduce or improve the efficiency of this time for a week for example for a site campaign, where the O&M team is spending on site. Instead of five days, for example, you reduce these to free days because you can just save on some time on the things. I\\u2019m just repeating myself here. The other two categories where one example was on soiling. When you know that in the 35% of the plant the soiling rate is for example in lost terms 5%, you could focus on these 35% first or only. And this is then improving in a higher leverage the performance of the plant, let\\u2019s maybe say up 1-2%. You\\u2019re reducing quickly 50% of your soiling losses and you\\u2019re spending also cleaning by 60%. The last category was the spare part management. When you know better for this site what is specifically necessary for that site by experience from analyzing the plant, then you can dedicate better the spare parts, which is there at stock. If this is combined with the asset management system, which has already maybe a spare part inventory, then this can be structured very efficiently. On the question you had before about comparison of preventive to predictive or prescriptive maintenance: I think we have also not lost numbers but I think it is quite easy when you say instead of doing an activity every year \\u2013 standard \\u2013 you basically extend these two maybe every two years, every three years. Then everybody can calculate, what it can be in terms. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Great point, G\\u00fcnter. I think obviously supply chain and minimizing cost across your supply chain as it is integrated with asset management and overall the monitoring system, I think it does have a very natural progression and that\\u2019s how I think holistically it should be looked at. So that\\u2019s a great point. Daniel, would you have some case studies to share? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): Yes, for sure. Very good points brought up so far. We think that improving is our duty and a reduction of O&M cost is part of it. So definitely there\\u2019s a lot of customers that are spending a huge amount of hours in the offices, trying to figure out what\\u2019s going on with their assets. We need to reduce those hours drastically. Then the other point we need to support the people that are working out in the field. There\\u2019s a lot of trackers that are not being monitored. There\\u2019s a lot of strings that are not being monitored. There\\u2019s a lot of soiling problems. There\\u2019s a lot of shading problems. There\\u2019s different a performance sense within the same solar farms that need to be monitored and we need to put the focus on the spotlight on all these problems so we save a lot of time for field personnel. And then the other item is having a strong CMMS system to be able to have your like you were mentioning your inventory under control, your people under control, your consumables, your spare parts, everything. And a lot of companies are doing this in-house so you can have everything under control. But a lot of companies are also outsourcing this. So by knowing when you have to do these actions you could also say: \\u201cOK. Maybe it\\u2019s cheaper to do it at this point in time of the year because the market is not so busy at the moment.\\u201d So all of these items that we mentioned, have to be taken into account. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Great, excellent point. When data aggregation is another contentious issues and it does come up as a key enabler in drawing the best out of your data. So Virgil, how do you view data aggregation or basically consolidating data across your portfolio of assets and what are the benefits you can reap out of it? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): Yes, that\\u2019s a great question and this may sound easy to be done, but actually is quite challenging from an O&M perspective. Centralizing the production data, the past, the importing, project spending, the stakeholder management in one place. It\\u2019s a very complex work, especially when you are also in an international environment. But the benefits which this in return \\u2013 and again, it sometimes a tedious work to do it \\u2013 is actually great, because you can have as we put this 360-degree view of the assets under management and you can see in one place, in one platform, an asset management platform, you can see all the events which relate to certain assets. And again for us, events are not just the monitoring events and the alarms, but also all the communication with the customers or the reports which were created, all the financials around that system. And that\\u2019s actually because we were talking previously about the context that actually gives context to all the data points, which can be very diverse as you can see. It gives sense and you can actually then think about how you can offer added value services to the customers. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Excellent. Johannes, this is probably something that you deal with on a regular basis, because your focus is on the distributed energy area. And I know you touched upon this, but dealing with aggregation of data across a portfolio, whether it\\u2019s a microgrid or whether it\\u2019s your C&I customers, what has been your biggest challenge in terms of consolidation? And would you share an example of how you go about solving an issue like that? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Well, we\\u2019re still working on it, but, it\\u2019s still a challenge. And with new customers there come new challenges. So I don\\u2019t think that we do something special there or that we are different from all the other big players because this is something everybody has to deal with. So if you have different data gateways or data loggers in place. Whether you have string, trackers or combiner boxes or whatever data you\\u2019re connecting, you always have the challenge to bring this to a level that you can analyze it. As mentioned before, getting cleaned data in the first place to properly analyze it is the biggest challenge. This is kind of our core that we process the data in the way that we can actually then visualize it in one way. But I don\\u2019t think that we struggle there with things that not everybody, who does it, has experienced. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): And is there a particular kind of customer group who are more interested in aggregated data? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Well, those who want to work with it. So those who prefer to work professionally with it. Of course, they are looking into the next potential. Whatever you developed last year is now status quo and you have to evolve. You have to move forward. But there are still a lot of installers, small scale installers and small scale EPCs, that are just learning. They are starting now to experience PV. I guess at the end of the day the more professional you are, the higher your standards. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thank you. G\\u00fcnter, OPEX and data aggregation. Do you have some thoughts to share? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): We standing here a bit on the sideline, but just on the question you also had before about if there is a specific group of customers. Well, I think it is specifically those customers which have large diverse portfolios. For example, customers which are in a very aggressive acquisition mode, which are looking for underperforming assets. Then they have very diverse assets in size. Also, the local monitoring systems are always different. So it\\u2019s a big challenge to harmonize all those sets because you have also different starting conditions. I mean Humberto just came in. I think he could probably speak about two hours about that topic. He is here the better person to speak. But what I wanted to say is about OPEX: The harmonization and the consolidation are bringing a bit of an addition on OPEX because you will also pay for this, let\\u2019s say central monitoring or asset management system. On the other hand, I think it is clearly reducing the confusion within the company. Because what we all often hear is that people say: \\u201cI have two, three different sets of data and they do not know what is right and how it is correlating.\\u201d And I think this is a big task, bringing this together so that you have one data set where you think you can rely on. I believe the costs of confusion in the company is hard to quantify. You see just what you are paying, but you are not seeing clearly what you\\u2019re then saving. Because unproductive time is a bit difficult to count. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure. Daniel? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): Like we were mentioning, data consolidation and aggregation is key, especially with the very large customers that are joining the industry, adding gigawatts of PV per year. So definitely each customer needs to have a solution that is catered for them. Are utilities going to ask for something different compared to an investor for example? But definitely data aggregation platforms are key and they\\u2019re going to have a huge role in these years coming, what we\\u2019re looking forward to right now. And one of the other main items to mention about this topic is, what we were talking before and we also mentioned: The quality of the data that we receive for these platforms is key. You won\\u2019t be able to work properly with them if you don\\u2019t have it. And so is saving decision-making time for people working with these assets. Having gigawatts of renewable energy, PV, in your system, you need to have these data aggregation systems in place, so it can work efficiently. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure. I mean, scale, like all of you mentioned, is one of the key enablers for ensuring that you aggregate your data. But we also spoke to a few asset managers who say that having different assets and different geographies of the world has also created a lot of issue of data aggregation. So this asset manager that I spoke to had massive GW capacity in Europe and in APAC, and they wanted to put that all on the same dashboards. But they were coming from different O&M companies. So there you go. We need, we need a standardized data aggregation consolidation tool. So that brings us to this very interesting topic of models. Would you shed some light on how it\\u2019s done \\u2013 Insourcing vs. outsourcing? And why have you chosen to do it a particular way? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): That\\u2019s not a straight forward answer because it depends on what type of activities you want to perform. Our way of working in Baywa is that we do certain activities in-house. Also, we believe that we have lots of knowledge and we have lots of digital tools that we develop based on this knowledge. Always having also an outside influx of ideas and maybe different ways of even the same things that we are doing, had us to iterate and go forward with new services that also the customers are expecting. And now in terms of if there is a real split of digital services, we are working with startups. So our mostly as our VC arm that we have, we work with different startups to also understand and make sense of what type of digital services can be used and actually can bring value. Because it\\u2019s a lot of also buzzwords out there and, also a lot of smoke in terms of what all these buzzwords can bring. And actually, when you put them at work you see that it\\u2019s maybe not valuable to the customer or what he is willing to pay. But I think a balance at this moment is difficult to clearly define. Doing all the big data in house, because also there are all the constraints from a contextual point of view. Also, there are all the regulations from each country, which have to be taken into account. And then, of course, the complexity. It\\u2019s growing by each portfolio that you are managing. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure. So Johannes, with your customers, how have you seen this model change? If they were doing it in-house earlier and now they have reached out? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): This insourcing/outsourcing topic is from my perspective more a question regarding focus. So what Virgil was just pointing towards: You have to think about what\\u2019s your focus, what\\u2019s your strength, what is supposed to be a strength. And data aggregation for sure is something you can work full time on. And if that\\u2019s for instance not supposed to be your focus or your strong point in the market, you shouldn\\u2019t do it. But if you have the size like Baywa, I guess that\\u2019s the point where it becomes also a key strength. So it does make sense to take this in. Our customers, of course mostly small, there are many which tried to do the entire thing themselves for a very long time. And now they approach us because they don\\u2019t want to try everything at the same time. The market is evolving. CAPEX is going down, OPEX is rather rising. But the importance of OPEX is becoming more important. If you\\u2019re an O&M, you have to manage this. You cannot do everything at the same time. So if your focus is clear, it\\u2019s very a straight forward decision whether you want to insource or outsource a certain task. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): G\\u00fcnter, your take on doing it themselves and outsourcing? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): As we have heard yesterday, there is not one best practice fitting all. But I think there are some rules and one thing is that, when it comes to monitoring systems and monitoring data, I believe a rule should be that the owner owns the monitoring system and the data and not the O&M or somebody else because data has a value. And this value of data is increasing. There are some people in the industry which when they are developing energy management systems, they say: \\u201cThe data and the knowledge for when the kWh is produced, is maybe higher than the kWh produced one day.\\u201d On analytics, outsourcing/insourcing: We believe that one of the best solutions for large companies is that they are using highly developed analytics platforms because this is what we are selling. But I believe it is also advisable that they have expert teams in house, which have the core knowledge of the performance and analytics. This is for the big players. I think for the small players or niche players which have maybe just a finance team, there may be a doable solution is that you use an analytic system, but also the analytics provider is adding a team as technical advisors, so that you get the support as well, not just using the product. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Daniel? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): For us at the end being done in-house or outsourcing it, is not that big of a deal. The importance at the end is to support the company, to support your customer and be able to cater to their needs. There are companies that are growing so fast that they can interiorize all these systems or things that they would like to do. And we like to bring to the table the knowledge that we\\u2019ve acquired for working with so many customers, to be able to guide customers and learn from them also. So working in-house or out-house, it depends on the company and how it works for them. Definitely, we would like to give this opportunity to customers to learn from us and to be able to start internalizing some of the services that we provide. So we\\u2019re open to both solutions. At the end, doing it right, having good quality data and producing good reports, good KPIs, good analytics that help put the focus on where the problems are coming from, is more important than just thinking: \\u201cShould we do it in-house or out-house?\\u201d Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure, leveraging best practices, right? And that brings us back to how Daniel started this session today. Would you, Daniel, also share, how you see some of the best practices that can be leveraged from the wind digitization journey? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): I think, we would all agree that wind is a step ahead of PV. Like we were talking before like we\\u2019ve talked in so many sessions: We need to bring that sensoring that we have in wind into PV. When you go and buy a wind turbine in Dubai from Vestas everything is included: for example, Siemens, whomever, your switch gear, your gearbox, your generator, everything is interlinked and it behaves like one system. In PV that doesn\\u2019t happen. We need to bring suppliers into working together much earlier. So right now we have like 50 systems that are working independently, one from each other. So we need to bring this to the table. For wind, we\\u2019ve gone a step ahead and there\\u2019s a lot of predictive maintenance that is being already done. Machines diagnose themselves, know when something is going wrong when they need to stop when they need to restart. In PV we\\u2019re still figuring out what\\u2019s happening in our field because of the lack of sensoring, the lack of good quality data, the lack of knowing what\\u2019s going on. So definitely we need to bring all the experience and the come together and work together that was done in wind and bring it over on to PV. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): I\\u2019m coming back to Baywa, Virgil. I think you would probably have a couple of comments to make on how we can share best practices from wind to solar? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): Monitoring both technologies and doing the management, technical and commercial management, we have the luxury to exchange internally the experience. Because it\\u2019s a digital panel I would maybe stop to one example that\\u2019s again about buzzwords: A.I. and machine learning. They started a bit earlier in terms of developing self-services around the sensors from the turbines. I think what we can learn from there is that even the data which is collected from a turbine, which has hundreds of sensors, you want to do predictive maintenance on different components, a gearbox, IT systems and so on. And even if you have a lot of data coming from these sensors the results, which machine learning A.I. can bring, can be very skewed by the context. It\\u2019s always based on how you train the data sets by the experts from that wind industry. And now projecting to the PV side, where you have far less sensors and even the ones you have them on-site, most of the time they are decalibrated or sending the wrong data, it makes this even more complicated. All these future systems and algorithms which will give the success that we are looking for by standardization across components of the plants and the better integration between them will help us. That\\u2019s one of the lessons that we have learned. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thank you, Virgil. Johannes, any thoughts to share on how we can leverage wind digitization? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): I\\u2019ve been sailing twice, but my experience in wind is very limited, to be honest. I think also the time is up. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Can we have one last comment from G\\u00fcnter, if that\\u2019s okay? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): On this topic or on any topic or on this wind topic you mean? Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): No, on best practices or anything else, if you would like to add something. G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): Best practices I see in a way that \\u2013 I repeat just what I think the gentleman from Wood Mackenzie first said \\u2013 in order to move forward, it is important that all stakeholders are kind of having the interest to work together. That sounds always a bit boring, but I think here it is very much true because the value of data and insights exists only when it is used. It doesn\\u2019t matter when one stakeholder has data and insights, but other stakeholders have no access to it. Then nobody can benefit from progressing. We are trying to work together with other companies. For example, I\\u2019m very happy that we have a project with Above, which is a drone company, where we are trying to correlate the permanent analytics results with the information you get from drones. We believe this is a very good fit. I believe that sooner or later this is merging together anyway. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Excellent. With that, I would like to thank our amazing panel today. Do we have any questions? Okay. So please feel free to reach out to them later. And thank you all for your patience.

The average operator is using 6-8 different portals to monitor its plants. On top of that, most of these portals are the solution provided by inverter OEMs, which are mostly fine for personal use, but lack features as a professional tool. Exel Solar, one of the leading solar PV distributor companies in Mexico, noticed these inefficiencies and made it its mission to find a professional, hardware-independent solution for the Mexican market. After almost a year of thorough research, they were down to 4 possible solutions. Exel Solar announced on February 2nd 2020 that they picked us as its monitoring solution. \\u201cChoosing the right monitoring partner is a crucial decision in our growth strategy, so we put a lot of time into research and comparison to make sure we choose the best option for us and especially for all of our customers,\\u201d says Daniel Alejandro Duque Flores, C&I and Projects Director at Exel Solar. \\u201cNext to features, the solution had to be easy to use but also strong and dynamic to grow at the same pace our market is growing. Fast onboarding of PV-plants and low recurring costs are also very important factors if we want to scale. After 8 months of intensive research, we chose Solytic. We really liked the interface optimized for boosting our productivity. Just the fact that we can now monitor all our plants from a single portal without installing any new components, is just amazing. If we want to monitor thousands of plants, we need to be as effective as possible. That combined with the attractive pricing structure enables us to charge half the price for monitoring to our customers compared with the other solutions.\\u201d Exel Solar plans to onboard more than 1000 plants in 2020 to our monitoring portal. The onboarding itself and the customer support will be provided by Exel Solar. Although we monitor more than 100,000 plants in over 42 countries, we mainly focussed our marketing and sales efforts on our home markets \\u2013 Germany, Austria and Switzerland \\u2013 in our first 2 years since founding. But with our recent series A funding round we are now prepared to expand internationally. As our first partnership in the Americas, this marks an important milestone for Solytic. Exel Solar has the experience, the resources, local market insights and strategic foresight to make this very successful. Opening our own offices all over the world would take a lot of resources that we would rather use to make our product better. That\\u2019s why we prefer to cooperate with strong partners like Exel Solar. Become a partner?

II. Provision of Software, scope and limitations of use Provision of Software: Provider shall make the Software indicated in the Framework Agreement (the combination of modules specified in the Framework Agreement) (hereinafter the \\u201cSoftware\\u201d) available to Customer via online access for the duration of Subscription Period. Provider grants Customer, against payment of the Usage Fee by Customer, step by step (Zug um Zug) a non-exclusive, non-transferable right, valid for the duration of this Agreement, to access the Software and the related Documentation (the Software and the Documentation jointly referred to as \\\"Material\\\") pursuant to these GTC and the information provided in the Documentation without prejudice to mandatory statutory provisions in accordance with the scope of use stated in the Framework Agreement via the log-in data sent by Provider, and to use it for its own business purposes in accordance with the above. Provider is entitled but not obliged to install updates to the extent that this serves to improve the use of the Software. Customer is not entitled to time availability of the software or 100% data availability. Scope of use and Functionalities: Subject to the provisions of this contract (in particular the information contained in the Framework Agreement), Customer is entitled to use the Material to the extent specified in the Framework Agreement (Subscription Period, number of users) for its own purposes, including advising its customers. Customer shall ensure that the Material is used exclusively by the authorised user(s) specified in the Framework Agreement. The scope of use shall include the combination of modules specified in the Framework Agreement with the functionalities described in the Documentation. Restriction of Use:Customer undertakes to use the Software in accordance with the contract and not to pass it on to third parties (persons other than the authorized users named in the Framework Agreement), nor to make it accessible to third parties in any other way. Customer is not entitled to reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, duplicate or to use any part of the Software to create a separate application. Customer undertakes (i) not to modify, copy, use or create derivative works of the Software in any manner whatsoever, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement (ii) not to attempt to circumvent, deactivate or thwart technical restrictions of use of the Software; (iii) not transfer, sell, rent, lease, distribute, sublicense, loan or otherwise transfer the Software, in whole or in part, to any third party (other than those authorized users named in the Framework Agreement); (iv) not modify or remove any proprietary notices on the Software; (v) not use the Software to provide its own time-sharing services, software-as-a-service (\\\"SaaS\\\") offerings, service office or as part of any application service provider or service offering. Customer is not entitled to connect the Software with other computer programs that were not allowed by the Provider. A connection in the aforementioned sense does not include the use of the Software on an operating system which controls the essential functions of a computer and enables its use. The Software and its components may not be unbundled for use on different computers. In particular, the unbundling or repackaging of the Software for distribution, transfer or (further) rental is not permitted. If Customer violates any of the above provisions, all rights of use granted within the framework of the agreement shall immediately become invalid and automatically revert to Provider. Provider shall be entitled to block access to the Software. In each case, Customer shall immediately and completely cease using the Software. Provider is entitled to demand from Customer a list of those persons who actually use the Software within the scope of the granted right of use in the event of circumstances which indicate the use of the Software by persons other than the authorised users. Customer is obliged to prepare such list fully and truthfully immediately after the request of Provider and to make it available to Provider. If Customer does not properly fulfill its obligation to prepare such a list or if the list is incorrect and/or incomplete, Provider is entitled to extraordinarily terminate the relevant right of use. Further claims of Provider remain unaffected. Provider is entitled to all industrial property rights attached to the Material or existing in connection therewith. Customer's ownership of data carriers, data storage devices and other hardware shall not be affected thereby, nor shall Customer's rights to the consulting cases saved and stored in the download file. However, Customer shall ensure that before the destruction, sale or other forms of transfer of data carriers, data storage devices or other hardware, any Material stored therein is completely deleted. III. Provision of the Software, Operating Conditions and System Requirements The use of the Software begins with the initial provision of the Software by the enabling of its use (e.g. by sending the information required for log-in). The Software was developed for use with an Internet Browser and will be optimized on the newest Version of the Google Chrome TM Browser. These operating conditions are specified in the Framework Agreement. If the Software is used without compliance with such operating conditions, Provider's warranty obligations in accordance with these conditions of use shall lapse. Customer shall ensure that the system requirements stated in the Framework Agreement te are available to it. IV. Warranty (Gew\\u00e4hrleistung); Duties of Customer to Cooperate In the event of defective performance, Customer shall be entitled to first demand rectification of the defect and, if the defect has not been rectified within four weeks of notification, to a reasonable reduction of the Usage Fee for the duration of the defect. Provider does not guarantee that the complex Software is free of defects, errors, bugs or temporary server failures despite the greatest possible care. Customer is obliged to make available to Provider verifiable data and information on the type and occurrence of deviations from the Service Description of the Software and to as-sist with locating and identifying errors and sources of errors. V. Liability Provider is only liable for the loss of data up to the amount necessary for recovering the data if it had been properly and regularly backed up. Provider shall be liable for damages based on wilful or grossly negligent or malicious breach of duty of Provider, its legal representatives or agents. If Provider is liable for grossly negligent breach of duty according to sentence 1, liability shall be limited to the foreseeable, typically occurring damage. Provider shall also be liable for damages caused by simple negligence if the neglince concerns essential contractual obligations, the observance of which is of special significance for achieving the object of the contract and on whose observance Customer may regularly rely (cardinal duties). In this case, liability shall be limited to the foreseeable, typically occurring damage. Provider shall further be liable to an unlimited extent for damages to life, body and health occuring due to negligent or wilful breach of duty. Furthermore, if Provider has warranted procurement or durability of the contractual products, Provider shall be liable within the scope of this warranty. Any further contractual or statutory liability - unless required by law - is excluded, irrespective of the legal nature of the asserted claim. If liability of Provider is excluded or limited, this shall also apply to personal liability of employees, workers, staff, representatives and agents of Provider as well as to liability of Provider for their conduct. VI. Industrial Property Rights and Copyrights; Defects of Title Unless otherwise agreed, Provider is obliged to carry out delivery free of industrial property rights and copyrights of third parties (hereinafter: \\u201cProperty Rights\\u201d) only in the country of the place of performance. If a third party asserts justified claims against Customer on account of the infringement of Property Rights due to deliveries carried out by Provider in accordance with the contract, Provider shall be liable to Customer as follows: Provider shall, at its discretion and at its own expense, obtain a right of use for the relevant deliveries, modify them in such a way that Property Rights are not infringed or replace them if and insofar as the functionality of Software is not significantly impaired as a result. If this is not possible for Provider under reasonable conditions or if Provider's subsequent performance fails within a reasonable grace period set by Customer, Customer may withdraw from contract or reduce the price under the statutory conditions. Provider's obligation to pay damages shall be governed by section V of these GTC. The aforementioned obligations of Provider shall only exist if Customer immediately and in writing informs Provider about the claims asserted by the third party, does not acknowledge an infringement and all defence measures and settlement negotiations remain reserved to Provider; in this context, Customer shall grant Provider all authorizations and powers necessary to defend the Software against the asserted rights of third parties. If Customer stops using Services for damage reduction or other important reasons, it shall be obliged to notify the third party that the suspension of use does not constitute an acknowledgement of an infringement of Property Rights. To the extent Customer is responsible for the infringement of Property Rights, claims of Customer shall be excluded. Claims of Customer shall also be excluded insofar the infringement of Property Rights is caused by special requirements of Customer, by an application not foreseeable by Provider or by a change to the delivery made by Customer. Provider reserves unrestricted property rights, copyrights and resulting exploitation rights regarding cost estimates, drawings, manuals and other documents (hereinafter: \\u201cDocuments\\u201d). Documents may only be made accessible to third parties with prior consent of Provider and, if the order is not placed with Provider, must be returned immediately upon Provider\\u2019s request. In the event of other defects of title, the provisions in section IV of these GTC (material defect warranty) shall apply accordingly. Further or other claims of Customer against Provider and Provider\\u2019s vicarious agents due to a defect of title than those regulated in this section VI are excluded. VII. Customer's own content Insofar Customers are permitted to post their own content using the Software, the following shall apply: Customers may upload or have uploaded their own content (e.g. images and texts), provided that the data room made available for this purpose is sufficient. The Customer does not have any claim to the publication of submitted content, nor to the permanent retention of content on the website. The Provider is thus permitted to remove content that has already been published. The Provider accepts no responsibility for the content, correctness and form of the information provided. Furthermore, the Customer undertakes to protect the rights of third parties and not to violate them. These include in particular trademark rights, personal rights and copyrights. It is not permitted to post content that glorifies violence, is pornographic or discriminatory. Also inadmissible is the content to violate the personal honour or to offend against the law or morality. VIII. References and Links The following applies insofar as the Software contains links or references to third-party websites: The responsibility for these external contents lies solely with the third party providing the contents. The role of the Provider lies solely in providing access to the use of this content. The Provider has no influence whatsoever on the current design, content or authorship of the linked pages. For this reason, the Provider hereby expressly distances himself from all contents of all linked pages vis-\\u00e0-vis the Customer and other third parties. For illegal, incorrect or incomplete contents and in particular for damages arising from the use or non-use of information provided by third parties, the third party alone shall be liable as the provider of the page to which reference is made and not the party who merely refers to the respective publication via links. IX. Support and Updates Provider reserves the right to change, supplement or delete the design and content of the website without prior notice or to temporarily or permanently cease publication of the services. As far as chargeable services are concerned by this, the provider will offer an equivalent alternative or refund the received payment to the user proportionately at his choice. Insofar as claims are granted in these GTC due to changes or discontinuation of Services or the Website, the User shall not be entitled to any claims for damages, reimbursement of expenses or other claims. Customer may contact Provider via email to solve problems and possible malfunctions with regard to the Software. This form of support constitutes an additional service that is free of charge for the Customer and may be supplemented or changed by Provider at any time. Provider is expressly entitled to commission subcontractors to process Customer's email inquiries. Email inquiries of Customer are to be sent to the following email address: info@solytic.com. The email shall contain a description of the technical problem, the user name, the web browser used and any other relevant information describing the matter. Further details to be included are the contact details (telephone numbers) through which the respective Customer can be reached. Customer shall ensure that in any communication with Provider or the subcontractors commissioned by Provider for the provision of care and maintenance services, customer data is only transmitted in anonymous form and there would be no direct inferrences to individual natural persons. If Provider receives personal data from end customers within the scope of the support in contravention of the above provision, the provisions of section XII of these GTC shall apply mutatis mutandis to such personal data. X. Transfer; Assignment Customer is not entitled to assign rights attached to the Material, in particular the right to use the Software, to third parties without the prior written consent of Provider. If an assignment and/or transfer in the aforementioned sense has nevertheless taken place, Customer is obliged to inform Provider of the name and address of the third party. Further rights of Provider in the event of unlawful assignment and/or transfer of the Software shall remain unaffected. XI. Confidentiality Customer is obliged to protect the Software from unauthorized access by third parties and shall ensure that the Material (including the Software) is not copied, publicated or otherwise disclosed in whole or in part unless permitted under user agreement. Customer acknowledges that the Software contains valuable confidential information and trade secrets, and that unauthorized use and/or unauthorized copies may cause damage to Provider. Customer undertakes towards Provider to keep secret all confidential information that has become or will become known to it before and/or during execution of this agreement, in particular to prevent any access to such information by third parties. Customer shall oblige all its entitled users, employees and contractors to maintain secrecy to the same extent, unless they are already obliged to do so under their employment contract. Confidential information in the sense of this agreement is all information marked as confidential by Provider or information whose confidentiality is evident from the circumstances. The obligation to maintain secrecy according to section XI.2 shall not apply to confidential information (i) already known or generally known when Customer became aware of it or which becomes known without breach of confidentiality obligations; (ii) provided to Customer by a third party without breach of confidentiality obligations towards Provider; (iii) developed by Customer independently of this agreement or (iv) if and insofar as the confidential information is to be surrendered based on an enforceable administrative or court order and Customer has immediately informed Provider after becoming aware of the disclosure obligation and given Provider the opportunity to take action against the disclosure. XII. Data Protection and Order Processing If Customer transmits personal data to Provider in a non-anonymous form, Customer shall be solely responsible \\u2013 with regard to the legal relationship between the parties \\u2013 for the legality (under data protection regulation) of the transmission of data to Provider and its contractually agreed collection, processing or use. In this respect, Customer shall in particular ensure that the requirements for order data processing are met, so that Provider, as an order data processor for Customer, may collect, process or use personal data of third parties within the scope of the use of the Software or the provision of services. For this purpose, the parties conclude the agreement on order data processing attached to these terms and conditions and in accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Provider uses personal data provided by Customer exclusively for the performance and execution of the contract. As far as Provider is controller within the meaning of data protection law, the natural persons whose personal data is stored by Provider are entitled to the rights of information, correction, blocking and deletion granted by the GDPR. These rights shall be exercised by sending a message by post or by electronic mail to the following e-mail address: info@solytic.com. If Provider acts as Customer's order data processor, Customer shall be entitled to the corresponding rights of information. After contractual relationship expires, personal data shall be deleted immediately. Such deletion shall be replaced by a blockage of data if deletion is not permitted because of legal, statutory or contractual retention periods, in particular, but not exclusively, for the execution of the contract. XIII. Term; Termination Subject to the Framework Agreement, this Agreement shall enter into force upon its conclusion and shall be in effect for the period specified in the Framework Agreement. The right to extraordinary termination of this contract for good cause remains unaffected. In particular, the following shall be considered good cause for extraordinary termination by Provider: Customer being more than four (4) weeks in default with payment or Customer providing third parties with unauthorized access to Software. An extraordinary termination is furthermore permissible with two (2) weeks\\u2019 notice if Provider becomes aware that Customer or another user has violated the terms of use, in each case provided that Provider has cautioned the contractual partner and that within a period of two (2) weeks after caution the violation has not ceased and no proof has been delivered that the violation is not ongoing. Termination shall be exercised in writing (e-mail to the address provided by the other party is sufficient). Upon termination of this agreement, all rights of Customer to use the Software and the Material shall expire. Customer shall return to Provider the Material and any copies made thereof or delete or destroy them in accordance with Provider's instructions and, at Provider's request, provide written confirmation as proof of compliance with this obligation. All payment obligations relating to this agreement and arising before termination of con-tract and all provisions regarding confidentiality, ownership, industrial property rights as well as protection and restrictions regarding use of the Material shall continue to apply even after partial or complete termination of this agreement. If Customer continues to use the Material (in particular the Software) after termination of usage agreement or if Customer does not prevent such use by another user, Customer shall be obliged to pay Provider compensation in the amount of the Usage Fee that would have incurred for the period of use and to compensate for any further damages if and insofar as Customer is responsible for the violation. XIV. Miscellaneous Customer may only offset its own claims against claims of Provider or assert rights of retention due to such claims if those claims are undisputed or legally established. If Customer is a merchant (\\u201cKaufmann\\u201d), legal entity of public law or of special fund under public law, the sole place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising directly or indirectly from the contractual relationship shall be the place of business of Provider. However, Provider shall also be entitled to file lawsuits at the general place of jurisdiction of Customer. The legal relations in connection with this contract shall be governed by German substantive law under exclusion of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). Provider remains entitled to change these GTC with effect for the future. Customer shall be informed of any such changes in writing (e-mail sufficient). Changes shall become effective unless Customer has objected to them in writing to Provider within four (4) weeks of receipt of notification pursuant to sentence 2. In written notification pursuant to sentence 2, Provider shall expressly notify Customer again of the significance and legal consequences if no objection is raised. If Customer objects to any changes to these GTC, both Provider and Customer may extraordinarily terminate the agreement affected by such change (Section XIII.2 of these GTC).

July 2, 2019 (updated July 23, 2019) | By Michael Kondula | 0 Comments Guest blog post by Michael Kondula, bos.ten AG Michael Kondula is the head of IT at O&M provider bos.ten from Regensburg, Germany. About a year ago, he learnt of Solytic. Previously, Kondula was long convinced that no one from outside could better display their internal IT processes, as they themselves. He changed this opinion after a test phase with Solytic for three of their PV plants. The company bos.ten is officially certified by T\\u00dcV Rheinland for the operation and maintenance of PV systems. We have repeatedly tested offerings from various monitoring providers hoping to find a solution where we could integrate and monitor all our assets from one platform. Partly a conversion of the hardware would have been necessary. However, that would have been associated with a financial overhead that we did not want our customers to bear. In turn, without retrofitting, it would have been very expensive to integrate the PV systems into the software at all. Too many different systems One potential monitoring provider worked with open interfaces and would have been able to integrate our assets. However, the cost of onboarding and implementing a sub-user structure for our customers was very high, far too high in the current market scenario. After all, all costs must be earned back by the solar asset. For us, it was very important that the colourful bouquet of PV systems with different technologies and components could be integrated into a portal without horrendous costs. That\\u2019s why we needed a hardware-independent monitoring solution. The portfolio of our operational systems alone comprises ten different inverter manufacturers, each with several different models. In addition, since the commissioning of our oldest power plant in 2003, the technical standard of solar parks has evolved considerably. Solytic was able to meet these requirements with ease and at a price that was extremely attractive compared to the other offerings available in the market. The variety of technology and integration of different component manufacturers was not the only challenge that faced bos.ten. Define users and assign earnings separately One of bos.ten\\u2019s solar parks is owned by more than 20 different investors, all of whom have to receive independent reports. So there is no classic participation model as with most other operators. This unique feature also means a higher effort. We have to be able to map this for each investor accordingly and correctly assign differentiated returns. Solytic was able to address this challenge too. The Berlin-based startup that prides itself in offering tailor-made solutions and was able to provide bos.ten with client and investor access as specifically required. After a short test phase with three assets, it became clear that the Solytic software was well suited to our requirements. The attractive price-performance ratio also played a role in our decision. Synergies through generalization Of course, having your own DIY solution also has its advantages; you can map everything just as it seems important and meaningful to your own company. For example, our clients require validated forecasting from yield assessments to finance their PV system. Accordingly, these commercial target values \\u200b\\u200bin our previous portal solution were compared with the generated earnings. These commercial values \\u200b\\u200bare irrelevant to Solytic\\u2019s technical plant monitoring. Therefore, you have to make a few small compromises with such an open solution. You have to wait for certain wishes because the focus from the viewpoint of the programmers is always on a generalization and not on a specialization. Nevertheless, our assessment was clearly in favour of Solytic. Finally, we save ourselves the time and the costs for the further development of the software. And for our sister companies, there were even greater synergies than originally expected: The partnership relationship with Solytic enables us to receive inquiries on nearly all of the bos.ten Group\\u2019s services, including plant control, PV substructures, and construction and maintenance services. An internal cost-benefit calculation made this clear to us. Because we save a lot of work every day if PV monitoring is becoming more automated. Because of this decision-making process, we have now got a good overview of the internal costs of our monitoring, uncovered potential savings and realized that the documentation of our facilities was not always as complete as we thought before. Monitoring is now much more intuitive and faster. Our employees do not need to have such a deep technical understanding of the equipment on site. As a result, the same team size can serve a much larger portfolio, and that drives our planned growth. Interface to CRM built-in A bidirectional interface between the monitoring software and our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) was particularly important to us. All tickets are managed there so that the bookkeeping and customer service have access. Solytic made it possible. We did not have to adapt our company to the software, Solytic provided a tailor-made solution. Last but not least, we also play an active role in the development of new features that add value to both sides. Advantages of a professional software solution outweigh For each decision, the pros and cons need to be weighed and that\\u2019s exactly what we did in this case. In the first step, we looked at and tested all relevant professional software solutions and compared the best of them with our in-house developed solution. In our case, we decided on Solytic, as we saw the greatest cost/benefit efficiency for us, especially in the long term. Make the right decision for your company!

Improving the Quality and Reliability of your Data @ PV Operations Europe 2020 April 1, 2020 (updated April 8, 2020) | By Niko Nather | 0 Comments At the beginning of March, experts addressed the following questions as part of a panel at PV Operations Europe 2020: How will the role of digitization and data play out in the next five or ten years from now? What are the challenges when it comes to generating efficient data? How are the needs of PV monitoring customers changing? How is digitization reducing costs when it comes to your OPEX? What are the benefits of data aggregation or consolidating data across portfolios of assets? What are the biggest challenges in data consolidation? Insourcing vs. outsourcing data aggregation? What are best practices that can be leveraged from the wind digitization journey? Listen to what the experts from Baywa r.e., Alteso, Isotrol and Solytic had to say: Transcript: Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Morning, everybody. My name is Pritil Gunjan and I am a senior analyst with Navigant Research, now a Guidehouse company. For those who don\\u2019t know us, we are a research and consulting firm. We\\u2019ve published reports in the energy sector. We have written various thought papers on how the industry has changed over the years. We started off with coal, gas, nuclear and now into renewables. I lead our distributed generation and renewable generation research services. I\\u2019m happy to discuss some of our thought papers. A very warm welcome to our colleagues from Baywa \\u2013 Virgil is probably online \\u2013 and then we have Inaccess, Isotrol\\u2026 I would request our panel members to please introduce themselves. May I have G\\u00fcnter? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): My name is G\\u00fcnter Maier. I\\u2019m from Alteso because there are some changes on the panel and Alteso is a data analytics company for photovoltaic power plants. Daniel Watson (Isotrol): Hello, my name is Daniel Ramirez Watson. I work for Isotrol and we\\u2019re a SCADA monitoring company with more than 38 GW of renewable energy being monitored by our system. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thanks, Daniel. Daniel Watson (Isotrol): Thank you. Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Hello, my name is Johannes Burgard. I\\u2019m managing director of Solytic. We do hardware-independent monitoring and build a marketplace for decentralised assets. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Hello Johannes. Great to have you here. And we also have Virgil joining online. Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for having me. I\\u2019m Virgil Cazacu. I\\u2019m leading the digital transformation within Baywa r.e., the service side and we are one of the largest O&M providers in Europe and solar was more than 8 GW under management. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Welcome, Virgil. So, kicking off with a stat here, because we are a research company. We estimate that the monitoring and control market for both solar and wind is going to cross 80 billion dollars in revenues cumulatively over the next 10 years. That\\u2019s a massive number and of course as we all know PV is going to play the biggest role as far as just digitization is concerned. So, with that number in mind how\\u2026 Let me start over, Johannes probably with you. How would you say digitization and data or the role of digitization and data will play out in the next five or ten years from now? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): In general, I think we had yesterday already in the discussion. When we look at digitization in general, when we look at PV, we see an enormous evolvement over the last years. 10 years ago we were already adding value if you showed data. If you actually show the information on your screen and you\\u2019re not you\\u2019re not relying on going on-site and analyzing everything on site but you could do it remotely. This, of course, is already adding a lot of value now and we\\u2019re moving forward. The digital technologies, in general, are moving very fast. We are now moving into decentralized innovation so we find a lot of potential to the left, to the right and especially in other industries. So I think it is very crucial for PV that we do not just focus on our own stuff in PV. But as we just had in the presentation, we have to look into different technologies into different sectors to really leverage the technological evolvement over the last years. Also in the next years, that we can really make advancements here. So I believe that looking into different sectors, looking into different industries, leveraging the inventions of other spaces will help us to really move forward. I see a lot of potential in the automation in the analysis. We have a lot of companies now working very heavily on A.I. This is something that of course always relies on the data quality that you have and the granularity. So we need to invest in hardware. We need to invest in the first level of technology so that we can actually build new features and advance in this space. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Great, thank you, Johannes. G\\u00fcnter. The role of data: How would you qualify that? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): Well, what we hear from our customers and from big players in Europe, in India is that they would like to have solutions, where the experts in the companies, the analysts, can rely already on a result coming from analytics for the purpose that they can then focus on the more sophisticated things and the actions they should take out of that. We hear from big players in Europe that they are spending most of their time with maybe the 10% to 20% problem sites and plants and the 80% of standard plants remain kind of unanalysed and unsupervised. And also we hear, that people are just expecting, that when the team is starting in the morning, there is already a list of up-to-date analytics results that it really can focus on. And I think it is not about, in this case, reducing teams or replacing people by technology. It is rather empowering people by technology that they can focus on things where maybe just people can focus on. And I think it is just\\u2026 I would expect that the future is bringing tools, which are like weapons for the people in that sense \\u2013 in the positive way \\u2013 where they can just use this equipment for doing their work more efficiently. We also get requests from customers that say: \\u201cI would like to have a toolbox where I just would like to select when I need an analytics tool.\\u201d It\\u2019s a bit of analytics on demand. So that you do not even subscribe for something on a permanent basis, you just choose whatever you want, when you need it. So I think this all will go much more lively and much more specific for the specific need. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Excellent. That is the new gold, right? Daniel let\\u2019s hear from you. Daniel Watson (Isotrol): We believe that digitalization is going to be key in PV like we were just talking about in wind. We\\u2019ve got to gather all that knowledge and bring it into the PV sector. We have to take into account the drop of costs that we\\u2019re having throughout the PV industry. Digitalization has to aid and help in this cost reduction. And we also have to take into account the human error that we always have. Digitalization has to help customers to be able to minimize this human error, that we all might have and improve our assets. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Excellent. I\\u2019m slightly different take from you, Virgil. How would you say the needs of customers have changed \\u2013 you being an O&M provider \\u2013 with regard to the role of data? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): I think the needs of the customers also evolved with the evolvement of the technologies. As now you can get more descriptive and predictive approaches in terms of the data and making sense of the data. And then customers are expecting to see more into the future than in the past as it happened a few years ago. So just creating reports about the past months or past year is by far not enough in the current set up. The data and especially the context around the data. Because you can look up into the data, you can find some issues, for example, in some strings. But without context actually you can not get the right decisions and at the end of the day helping the customers getting efficiency into the plants. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Now that\\u2019s a really excellent point. So the context of data is critical here. Any other challenges you would like to highlight when it comes to generating efficient data? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): So I think the operations teams make decisions based on the data that they received from different data sources: from monitoring providers, SCADA systems, data loggers, inverters, satellite irradiations, weather forecast service, financial systems. So there are lots of data streams, which are now coming into play and actually from our point of view digitalization is not just a specific technology but actually it\\u2019s context and it\\u2019s an ecosystem which brings together also the business processes, also the change management teams of people. Because even if you have the best A.I., it has to be proved in the context. And also it\\u2019s a human factor involved, where especially the engineers which are working in this area, they need to gain trust that relies on that data, which is coming out from a machine learning algorithm. That this can be trusted and is scalable. across the whole portfolio. So the quality of data is super important because that has an impact on the whole chain, which follows that data ingestion. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thank you, Virgil. Johannes is coming to you. Your experience with generating efficient data and some of the challenges you would like to share with us? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): It\\u2019s more collecting. We don\\u2019t generate so we are focused on software but what we have to handle there is quite a diverse field off of data. In our case, we focus on decentralized assets and that means that we are collecting data through email, through FTP pushes, through CSV files and also through VPN or whatever so it\\u2019s a very diverse field of data and that\\u2019s definitely not efficient. But that\\u2019s basically the problem that we are trying to solve. Providing one monitoring solution that combines all these things and that\\u2019s I think it\\u2019s something that we have to tackle. So the lack of standards and the lack of unification of all these protocols is just something that is definitely hindering us in moving forward fast because it\\u2019s impossible right now to buy a plug and play product off the shelf. Simply because it doesn\\u2019t exist, because it\\u2019s not possible to build it. So there\\u2019s a lot of potential to really get closer together and build standards so that we move towards efficient data, so we can really leverage all the intelligence that we have to the left and to the right. And then we can move forward there. Right now we are quite some distance away from that. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): And how does this relate to the needs of your customer changing? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Well, as mentioned before, it used to be already adding value, if you can show the data on your desktop. But that\\u2019s a long time ago now and now the customer demands they increase. Everybody wants very smart alarms because nobody wants this flood of alarms. Using static parameters for those alarms, for instance, is something that is very useful for large scale assets, but it\\u2019s impossible to adjust these for small scale. I think we heard it yesterday as well, about 50% of the assets and the capacity is actually in residential. So who\\u2019s taking care of these people. They usually are not engineers like us. They don\\u2019t want to take care of their asset. They want someone to tell them when they have to act. Here it\\u2019s very important that we move into that direction that we can help people without technical experience, without the background to still handle PV. Because then it becomes scalable and in the big scale. Then we can actually get renewables really going. Because compared to all the other energy resources that we are using today, PV is still very small. Those are the needs that we experience. That people don\\u2019t want to bother with the assets. They want it lean, efficient and there everybody is on the same page. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Especially in the distributed energy sector. G\\u00fcnter, your take on the issues and challenges of generating efficient data. G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): In our case, it\\u2019s also not generating data, but it does not matter. We have to focus on extracting data for letting the data flow into our engine. What we see is, first of all, a big variety of quality of data worldwide. But it is also worth to say that we see a lot of issues, where data is missing, unreliable, frozen data. Very often also data are basically there, but the matching in the monitoring is simply wrong. So you\\u2019re measuring things where you\\u2019ll get the results but you are measuring from the wrong equipment part because it\\u2019s just differently defined in the monitoring system. We see our role here in the way where we\\u2019re getting this data sanitized. A lot of customers, which maybe are big and which have acquired a variety of projects, they cannot really choose what monitoring system is behind. Sometimes there is almost no monitoring behind. Sometimes there\\u2019s monitoring behind, but this is so diverse. And these customers, they tell us: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to tell us, that we have a mess. We want you to overcome this mess.\\u201d This is why a lot of the work we are doing, is some work which is not necessarily seen because it is kind of working with the data until you have a data set where you say: \\u201cNow I can start to analyze.\\u201d And I believe this will still go on for quite a while because it cannot change or overnight. I believe this is also why we say: \\u201cAutomation, A.I., M.L. \\u2013 these are all very powerful things, which are coming.\\u201d But at the moment, honestly, we are working on getting the data right for getting analysis and valuable conclusions for the client. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure, technology enablers. Yes, of course, we need an A.I. and\\u2026 G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): Sorry, maybe one last sentence. Very often on the owner\\u2019s side or customer side, they are not aware, what is their data situation until we start with the work and can visualise, how much data are missing. Just an example: We did just a tracker optimization analysis for a plant and at the end, it was revealed that 80% of the tracker position data were missing. So you can not even do an analysis or optimization. But the first information is that we can at least equip the client with the information, that you can then go to his equipment supplier and monitoring system supplier and say: \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Isotrol perspective, Daniel? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): I think this is one of the main topics and I\\u2019m glad it comes up. Because poor data, bad quality data \\u2013 it\\u2019s a big problem in the industry. Therefore it\\u2019s mandatory to have data quality and data cleansing algorithms that help customers with this problem. And the lack of sensoring, it\\u2019s also a big problem in the industry. So we\\u2019d like to advise customers early in the game about what type of sensors they need to have and how they can monitor their assets correctly. Then the other big problem that we see is that a lot of PV farms don\\u2019t have real-time monitoring. So the data acquisition for that is pretty poor. So we highly recommend our customers to have real-time data being gathered, not every 15 minutes like a lot of PV plants are being done right now. So definitely real-time robust algorithms with data quality and cleansing and having a robust system and that acquisition and censoring throughout your PV farm. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thank you, Daniel. So Virgil, coming back to you. You know just taking what Daniel just mentioned: Having these diverse set of quality and quantity of the way data is generated. How would you then apply it to OPEX? Or do you have some case studies to share, where you\\u2019ve seen a real cost reduction when it comes to your OPEX? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): Just to underline one thing. Indeed we are talking about very advanced systems like machine learning, A.I. The reality is that we need to focus on reflecting what we are currently doing. That means perfecting performance ratios, the availabilities in order to meet these objectives and at the end of the day the financial returns for each asset. Having said that and related to the OPEX impact of digital tools, I can give you two examples from our side. One is the optimizations of the plants\\u2019 on-site related activities, which is actually technicians. They go on-site and they perform the necessary work to the PV plants which relates also to having better customer satisfaction. Because it\\u2019s a difference when someone goes on-site with some paper and pen and they do their work or they go with a digital solution, where they can capture all the findings and all the work. For example, for maintenance plants to capture all the necessary documentation and centralize it and then creating reports for different stakeholders in different formats more automatically, that definitely has an impact on the structures and on the OPEX. And zooming out from the plant to the monitoring part, improved decision making based on data analytics. That\\u2019s where we are focusing because we want to have a decrease of production cost to more focused, less operations, where the cleaning or the inspections can be done more focused on the pain points of the plants. So instead of just going for big plants just going and driving hectares and checking with drones all plants then we can, based on the data, have targeted inspections. That can bring optimization also in terms of spare parts management. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thanks, Virgil. Johannes, would you like to share some ideas of how it\\u2019s impacted the OPEX of your customers? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Well, it\\u2019s the point I made earlier. The combination of different monitoring solutions, the different data sources that we\\u2019re just combining, so our customers are using one monitoring instead of 15, which is something that is very common probably to everyone who is monitoring a couple of hundred megawatts or even in the gigawatt space. Those companies do it themselves. Of course and that\\u2019s good. So it\\u2019s not a new idea. It\\u2019s just something if you\\u2019re just a craftsman and you\\u2019re handling 500 assets and they\\u2019re all very small, you don\\u2019t have access to this technology that you build it yourself. So this obviously helps a lot in becoming more efficient on a daily basis. Something that we are working on together with customers right now is to take the next step. If you identify some default or some anomaly, how do you solve it? So going towards preventive maintenance is the standard, mostly correct of maintenance in the residential space, but then when we want to move towards prescriptive maintenance, so predictive for something we can\\u2019t do ourselves. So we are looking for partners there. But I think this is something that is very interesting in the future. To provide solutions and not just the information that something is wrong. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): And that\\u2019s again a really interesting point. So when you look at predictive maintenance versus prescriptive like you mentioned: What is the incremental cost to your customer? How do they really measure it? Do they look at it in terms of cost reductions or revenue targets? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): They don\\u2019t yet. And we don\\u2019t have it. It\\u2019s not that we\\u2019ve found the special sauce to create it, yet. For us really the use case right now is providing one monitoring solution instead of 15 and that is reducing a lot of complexity in the day to day business. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure. We\\u2019ll come back to integration. I think it\\u2019s a really pertinent topic in this industry. G\\u00fcnter, what\\u2019s your experience with OPEX and digitization? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): Concerning this topic, we have case studies which are coming from the analytics of course because this is our business. And in 2018 we did a white paper which is called \\u201cOPEX reduction coming from analytics\\u201d. Everybody can download this from our webpage. But to cut the long story short, we have described three different categories. One category was about the minimization and the reduction of any kind of physical inspection. So that you need not to spend so much time physically inspect something in order to find the issue. You know already the issue when for example you go either to the site or just to the specific stream. So you do not have to search or to test or to measure first in a quite time-consuming way. You know already where to go and you know already where to fix. On that the reduction of time, which is then of course also a bit of an equivalent in cost, is when an O&M is on-site anyway, then a reduction is possible by about 90%. Because instead of searching for it, they just focus on what they should mitigate repair. And they have done also the verification immediately available. When they do something they see if it was successful. And the customer sees it as well, which is important because it was they\\u2019re not you know a useless standard O&M activity at the site. You know already if there was a success. When the O&M team is not at the site, when it\\u2019s an external provider, then you can reduce or improve the efficiency of this time for a week for example for a site campaign, where the O&M team is spending on site. Instead of five days, for example, you reduce these to free days because you can just save on some time on the things. I\\u2019m just repeating myself here. The other two categories where one example was on soiling. When you know that in the 35% of the plant the soiling rate is for example in lost terms 5%, you could focus on these 35% first or only. And this is then improving in a higher leverage the performance of the plant, let\\u2019s maybe say up 1-2%. You\\u2019re reducing quickly 50% of your soiling losses and you\\u2019re spending also cleaning by 60%. The last category was the spare part management. When you know better for this site what is specifically necessary for that site by experience from analyzing the plant, then you can dedicate better the spare parts, which is there at stock. If this is combined with the asset management system, which has already maybe a spare part inventory, then this can be structured very efficiently. On the question you had before about comparison of preventive to predictive or prescriptive maintenance: I think we have also not lost numbers but I think it is quite easy when you say instead of doing an activity every year \\u2013 standard \\u2013 you basically extend these two maybe every two years, every three years. Then everybody can calculate, what it can be in terms. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Great point, G\\u00fcnter. I think obviously supply chain and minimizing cost across your supply chain as it is integrated with asset management and overall the monitoring system, I think it does have a very natural progression and that\\u2019s how I think holistically it should be looked at. So that\\u2019s a great point. Daniel, would you have some case studies to share? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): Yes, for sure. Very good points brought up so far. We think that improving is our duty and a reduction of O&M cost is part of it. So definitely there\\u2019s a lot of customers that are spending a huge amount of hours in the offices, trying to figure out what\\u2019s going on with their assets. We need to reduce those hours drastically. Then the other point we need to support the people that are working out in the field. There\\u2019s a lot of trackers that are not being monitored. There\\u2019s a lot of strings that are not being monitored. There\\u2019s a lot of soiling problems. There\\u2019s a lot of shading problems. There\\u2019s different a performance sense within the same solar farms that need to be monitored and we need to put the focus on the spotlight on all these problems so we save a lot of time for field personnel. And then the other item is having a strong CMMS system to be able to have your like you were mentioning your inventory under control, your people under control, your consumables, your spare parts, everything. And a lot of companies are doing this in-house so you can have everything under control. But a lot of companies are also outsourcing this. So by knowing when you have to do these actions you could also say: \\u201cOK. Maybe it\\u2019s cheaper to do it at this point in time of the year because the market is not so busy at the moment.\\u201d So all of these items that we mentioned, have to be taken into account. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Great, excellent point. When data aggregation is another contentious issues and it does come up as a key enabler in drawing the best out of your data. So Virgil, how do you view data aggregation or basically consolidating data across your portfolio of assets and what are the benefits you can reap out of it? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): Yes, that\\u2019s a great question and this may sound easy to be done, but actually is quite challenging from an O&M perspective. Centralizing the production data, the past, the importing, project spending, the stakeholder management in one place. It\\u2019s a very complex work, especially when you are also in an international environment. But the benefits which this in return \\u2013 and again, it sometimes a tedious work to do it \\u2013 is actually great, because you can have as we put this 360-degree view of the assets under management and you can see in one place, in one platform, an asset management platform, you can see all the events which relate to certain assets. And again for us, events are not just the monitoring events and the alarms, but also all the communication with the customers or the reports which were created, all the financials around that system. And that\\u2019s actually because we were talking previously about the context that actually gives context to all the data points, which can be very diverse as you can see. It gives sense and you can actually then think about how you can offer added value services to the customers. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Excellent. Johannes, this is probably something that you deal with on a regular basis, because your focus is on the distributed energy area. And I know you touched upon this, but dealing with aggregation of data across a portfolio, whether it\\u2019s a microgrid or whether it\\u2019s your C&I customers, what has been your biggest challenge in terms of consolidation? And would you share an example of how you go about solving an issue like that? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Well, we\\u2019re still working on it, but, it\\u2019s still a challenge. And with new customers there come new challenges. So I don\\u2019t think that we do something special there or that we are different from all the other big players because this is something everybody has to deal with. So if you have different data gateways or data loggers in place. Whether you have string, trackers or combiner boxes or whatever data you\\u2019re connecting, you always have the challenge to bring this to a level that you can analyze it. As mentioned before, getting cleaned data in the first place to properly analyze it is the biggest challenge. This is kind of our core that we process the data in the way that we can actually then visualize it in one way. But I don\\u2019t think that we struggle there with things that not everybody, who does it, has experienced. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): And is there a particular kind of customer group who are more interested in aggregated data? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): Well, those who want to work with it. So those who prefer to work professionally with it. Of course, they are looking into the next potential. Whatever you developed last year is now status quo and you have to evolve. You have to move forward. But there are still a lot of installers, small scale installers and small scale EPCs, that are just learning. They are starting now to experience PV. I guess at the end of the day the more professional you are, the higher your standards. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thank you. G\\u00fcnter, OPEX and data aggregation. Do you have some thoughts to share? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): We standing here a bit on the sideline, but just on the question you also had before about if there is a specific group of customers. Well, I think it is specifically those customers which have large diverse portfolios. For example, customers which are in a very aggressive acquisition mode, which are looking for underperforming assets. Then they have very diverse assets in size. Also, the local monitoring systems are always different. So it\\u2019s a big challenge to harmonize all those sets because you have also different starting conditions. I mean Humberto just came in. I think he could probably speak about two hours about that topic. He is here the better person to speak. But what I wanted to say is about OPEX: The harmonization and the consolidation are bringing a bit of an addition on OPEX because you will also pay for this, let\\u2019s say central monitoring or asset management system. On the other hand, I think it is clearly reducing the confusion within the company. Because what we all often hear is that people say: \\u201cI have two, three different sets of data and they do not know what is right and how it is correlating.\\u201d And I think this is a big task, bringing this together so that you have one data set where you think you can rely on. I believe the costs of confusion in the company is hard to quantify. You see just what you are paying, but you are not seeing clearly what you\\u2019re then saving. Because unproductive time is a bit difficult to count. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure. Daniel? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): Like we were mentioning, data consolidation and aggregation is key, especially with the very large customers that are joining the industry, adding gigawatts of PV per year. So definitely each customer needs to have a solution that is catered for them. Are utilities going to ask for something different compared to an investor for example? But definitely data aggregation platforms are key and they\\u2019re going to have a huge role in these years coming, what we\\u2019re looking forward to right now. And one of the other main items to mention about this topic is, what we were talking before and we also mentioned: The quality of the data that we receive for these platforms is key. You won\\u2019t be able to work properly with them if you don\\u2019t have it. And so is saving decision-making time for people working with these assets. Having gigawatts of renewable energy, PV, in your system, you need to have these data aggregation systems in place, so it can work efficiently. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure. I mean, scale, like all of you mentioned, is one of the key enablers for ensuring that you aggregate your data. But we also spoke to a few asset managers who say that having different assets and different geographies of the world has also created a lot of issue of data aggregation. So this asset manager that I spoke to had massive GW capacity in Europe and in APAC, and they wanted to put that all on the same dashboards. But they were coming from different O&M companies. So there you go. We need, we need a standardized data aggregation consolidation tool. So that brings us to this very interesting topic of models. Would you shed some light on how it\\u2019s done \\u2013 Insourcing vs. outsourcing? And why have you chosen to do it a particular way? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): That\\u2019s not a straight forward answer because it depends on what type of activities you want to perform. Our way of working in Baywa is that we do certain activities in-house. Also, we believe that we have lots of knowledge and we have lots of digital tools that we develop based on this knowledge. Always having also an outside influx of ideas and maybe different ways of even the same things that we are doing, had us to iterate and go forward with new services that also the customers are expecting. And now in terms of if there is a real split of digital services, we are working with startups. So our mostly as our VC arm that we have, we work with different startups to also understand and make sense of what type of digital services can be used and actually can bring value. Because it\\u2019s a lot of also buzzwords out there and, also a lot of smoke in terms of what all these buzzwords can bring. And actually, when you put them at work you see that it\\u2019s maybe not valuable to the customer or what he is willing to pay. But I think a balance at this moment is difficult to clearly define. Doing all the big data in house, because also there are all the constraints from a contextual point of view. Also, there are all the regulations from each country, which have to be taken into account. And then, of course, the complexity. It\\u2019s growing by each portfolio that you are managing. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure. So Johannes, with your customers, how have you seen this model change? If they were doing it in-house earlier and now they have reached out? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): This insourcing/outsourcing topic is from my perspective more a question regarding focus. So what Virgil was just pointing towards: You have to think about what\\u2019s your focus, what\\u2019s your strength, what is supposed to be a strength. And data aggregation for sure is something you can work full time on. And if that\\u2019s for instance not supposed to be your focus or your strong point in the market, you shouldn\\u2019t do it. But if you have the size like Baywa, I guess that\\u2019s the point where it becomes also a key strength. So it does make sense to take this in. Our customers, of course mostly small, there are many which tried to do the entire thing themselves for a very long time. And now they approach us because they don\\u2019t want to try everything at the same time. The market is evolving. CAPEX is going down, OPEX is rather rising. But the importance of OPEX is becoming more important. If you\\u2019re an O&M, you have to manage this. You cannot do everything at the same time. So if your focus is clear, it\\u2019s very a straight forward decision whether you want to insource or outsource a certain task. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): G\\u00fcnter, your take on doing it themselves and outsourcing? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): As we have heard yesterday, there is not one best practice fitting all. But I think there are some rules and one thing is that, when it comes to monitoring systems and monitoring data, I believe a rule should be that the owner owns the monitoring system and the data and not the O&M or somebody else because data has a value. And this value of data is increasing. There are some people in the industry which when they are developing energy management systems, they say: \\u201cThe data and the knowledge for when the kWh is produced, is maybe higher than the kWh produced one day.\\u201d On analytics, outsourcing/insourcing: We believe that one of the best solutions for large companies is that they are using highly developed analytics platforms because this is what we are selling. But I believe it is also advisable that they have expert teams in house, which have the core knowledge of the performance and analytics. This is for the big players. I think for the small players or niche players which have maybe just a finance team, there may be a doable solution is that you use an analytic system, but also the analytics provider is adding a team as technical advisors, so that you get the support as well, not just using the product. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Daniel? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): For us at the end being done in-house or outsourcing it, is not that big of a deal. The importance at the end is to support the company, to support your customer and be able to cater to their needs. There are companies that are growing so fast that they can interiorize all these systems or things that they would like to do. And we like to bring to the table the knowledge that we\\u2019ve acquired for working with so many customers, to be able to guide customers and learn from them also. So working in-house or out-house, it depends on the company and how it works for them. Definitely, we would like to give this opportunity to customers to learn from us and to be able to start internalizing some of the services that we provide. So we\\u2019re open to both solutions. At the end, doing it right, having good quality data and producing good reports, good KPIs, good analytics that help put the focus on where the problems are coming from, is more important than just thinking: \\u201cShould we do it in-house or out-house?\\u201d Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Sure, leveraging best practices, right? And that brings us back to how Daniel started this session today. Would you, Daniel, also share, how you see some of the best practices that can be leveraged from the wind digitization journey? Daniel Watson (Isotrol): I think, we would all agree that wind is a step ahead of PV. Like we were talking before like we\\u2019ve talked in so many sessions: We need to bring that sensoring that we have in wind into PV. When you go and buy a wind turbine in Dubai from Vestas everything is included: for example, Siemens, whomever, your switch gear, your gearbox, your generator, everything is interlinked and it behaves like one system. In PV that doesn\\u2019t happen. We need to bring suppliers into working together much earlier. So right now we have like 50 systems that are working independently, one from each other. So we need to bring this to the table. For wind, we\\u2019ve gone a step ahead and there\\u2019s a lot of predictive maintenance that is being already done. Machines diagnose themselves, know when something is going wrong when they need to stop when they need to restart. In PV we\\u2019re still figuring out what\\u2019s happening in our field because of the lack of sensoring, the lack of good quality data, the lack of knowing what\\u2019s going on. So definitely we need to bring all the experience and the come together and work together that was done in wind and bring it over on to PV. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): I\\u2019m coming back to Baywa, Virgil. I think you would probably have a couple of comments to make on how we can share best practices from wind to solar? Virgil Cazacu (BayWa r.e.): Monitoring both technologies and doing the management, technical and commercial management, we have the luxury to exchange internally the experience. Because it\\u2019s a digital panel I would maybe stop to one example that\\u2019s again about buzzwords: A.I. and machine learning. They started a bit earlier in terms of developing self-services around the sensors from the turbines. I think what we can learn from there is that even the data which is collected from a turbine, which has hundreds of sensors, you want to do predictive maintenance on different components, a gearbox, IT systems and so on. And even if you have a lot of data coming from these sensors the results, which machine learning A.I. can bring, can be very skewed by the context. It\\u2019s always based on how you train the data sets by the experts from that wind industry. And now projecting to the PV side, where you have far less sensors and even the ones you have them on-site, most of the time they are decalibrated or sending the wrong data, it makes this even more complicated. All these future systems and algorithms which will give the success that we are looking for by standardization across components of the plants and the better integration between them will help us. That\\u2019s one of the lessons that we have learned. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Thank you, Virgil. Johannes, any thoughts to share on how we can leverage wind digitization? Johannes Burgard (Solytic): I\\u2019ve been sailing twice, but my experience in wind is very limited, to be honest. I think also the time is up. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Can we have one last comment from G\\u00fcnter, if that\\u2019s okay? G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): On this topic or on any topic or on this wind topic you mean? Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): No, on best practices or anything else, if you would like to add something. G\\u00fcnter Maier (Alteso): Best practices I see in a way that \\u2013 I repeat just what I think the gentleman from Wood Mackenzie first said \\u2013 in order to move forward, it is important that all stakeholders are kind of having the interest to work together. That sounds always a bit boring, but I think here it is very much true because the value of data and insights exists only when it is used. It doesn\\u2019t matter when one stakeholder has data and insights, but other stakeholders have no access to it. Then nobody can benefit from progressing. We are trying to work together with other companies. For example, I\\u2019m very happy that we have a project with Above, which is a drone company, where we are trying to correlate the permanent analytics results with the information you get from drones. We believe this is a very good fit. I believe that sooner or later this is merging together anyway. Pritil Gunjan (Navigant Research): Excellent. With that, I would like to thank our amazing panel today. Do we have any questions? Okay. So please feel free to reach out to them later. And thank you all for your patience. Remote Working \\u2013 6 tips & 10 resources March 30, 2020 (updated March 30, 2020) | By Niko Nather | 0 Comments Even though we are 100% at home, we are 110% there for our customers and you can do it too. These are difficult times for all of us \\u2013 also in the solar industry. But we can assure you that we are there for you, as always, without restrictions, only from home. As a young digital company, we are very flexible and even before the crisis, we already had a home office. So we had no problem at all to work from home from one day to the next. One thing is clear: Together we will get through this! With this in mind, we would like to share with you 6 tips and 10 resources that have also helped us to stay productive during the transition from office to remote work: Always overcommunicate. This helps to keep everyone informed and lifts the spirits of the team. Set boundaries. When you\\u2019re working, you\\u2019re really working. Take breaks at regular intervals.

The average operator is using 6-8 different portals to monitor its plants. On top of that, most of these portals are the solution provided by inverter OEMs, which are mostly fine for personal use, but lack features as a professional tool. Exel Solar, one of the leading solar PV distributor companies in Mexico, noticed these inefficiencies and made it its mission to find a professional, hardware-independent solution for the Mexican market. After almost a year of thorough research, they were down to 4 possible solutions. Exel Solar announced on February 2nd 2020 that they picked us as its monitoring solution. \\u201cChoosing the right monitoring partner is a crucial decision in our growth strategy, so we put a lot of time into research and comparison to make sure we choose the best option for us and especially for all of our customers,\\u201d says Daniel Alejandro Duque Flores, C&I and Projects Director at Exel Solar. \\u201cNext to features, the solution had to be easy to use but also strong and dynamic to grow at the same pace our market is growing. Fast onboarding of PV-plants and low recurring costs are also very important factors if we want to scale. After 8 months of intensive research, we chose Solytic. We really liked the interface optimized for boosting our productivity. Just the fact that we can now monitor all our plants from a single portal without installing any new components, is just amazing. If we want to monitor thousands of plants, we need to be as effective as possible. That combined with the attractive pricing structure enables us to charge half the price for monitoring to our customers compared with the other solutions.\\u201d Exel Solar plans to onboard more than 1000 plants in 2020 to our monitoring portal. The onboarding itself and the customer support will be provided by Exel Solar. Although we monitor more than 100,000 plants in over 42 countries, we mainly focussed our marketing and sales efforts on our home markets \\u2013 Germany, Austria and Switzerland \\u2013 in our first 2 years since founding. But with our recent series A funding round we are now prepared to expand internationally. As our first partnership in the Americas, this marks an important milestone for Solytic. Exel Solar has the experience, the resources, local market insights and strategic foresight to make this very successful. Opening our own offices all over the world would take a lot of resources that we would rather use to make our product better. That\\u2019s why we prefer to cooperate with strong partners like Exel Solar. Become a partner? Vattenfall and EWE invest in Solytic February 25, 2020 (updated February 25, 2020) | By Niko Nather | 0 Comments Great news! We secured a medium seven-digit sum in our Series A round. The investment is led by Swedish energy company Vattenfall \\u2014 onboard since 2017 \\u2014 and EWE the Oldenburg-based energy company. Furthermore, a number of business angels join as additional investors, including THELO Investors. In just two years, we have become a leading service company in the field of data management for photovoltaic (PV) plants. We are the only company on the market that uses data from PV plants in a purely software-based solution to accelerate amortisation through comprehensively optimised performance. The bottom line is that our customers reach the breakeven point more quickly because they achieve a higher return on investment throughout the entire life cycle of the PV plant. The Series A financing will accelerate product development and international expansion. We currently employ 25 people and monitor more than 100,000 PV plants. The goal is to service one million plants within the next three years. For us, this cooperation on an equal footing with two of the five largest companies in Germany is an important step forward and confirmation that Solytic is on the right track. It gives us the necessary clout to further expand digital services in the solar market and to gain a strong market position. Without an immense expansion of power generation by solar plants, the energy transition to a CO2-neutral world will not be possible. \\u201cThe energy industry is undergoing a rapid transformation process. Vattenfall\\u2019s goal is to enable a fossil-free life within one generation. A cornerstone of our strategy is the further expansion of renewable energies,\\u201d says Gunnar Groebler, Senior Vice President at Vattenfall. \\u201cWe see significant growth potential in the solar sector. However, economic success depends on constructing renewable plants as cost-effectively as possible and operating them with data support. Therefore, the investment in a company like Solytic, which is clearly focused on digital services in this future-oriented area, is a very sensible investment for Vattenfall\\u201d, Groebler continued. In order for the energy transition to gain momentum, the costs of generating solar power must continue to fall. Currently, PV plants pay for themselves within 8-15 years. Our customers want to reach the break-even point faster. That is why we rely on automated analyses that identify and exploit potential. Currently, there are around 1.7 million PV plants in Germany alone. However, in light of rising electricity prices and growing environmental awareness, it can be assumed that the expansion of solar energy will continue to grow significantly. This demand is meeting with an extremely fragmented supply from a wide range of different service providers and manufacturers. Most buyers of solar plants are mainly interested in the yields and their degree of self-sufficiency. In order to enable plant owners to minimize their expenses while maximizing their yield, Solytic continuously evaluates the plant data and reports weaknesses and potentials to the operators with concrete proposals for solutions. \\u201cAs an energy company we want to offer our customers simple and convenient solutions that reduce the complexity of their everyday lives,\\u201d says Dr. Urban Keussen, Board Member for Technology and Innovation at the Oldenburg-based energy company EWE. \\u201cFor us, this also includes services from partners such as Solytic, with which our customers can save time and money. The provision of such services is then a sustainable benefit for everyone involved,\\u201d Keussen continues. Partnership with Microsoft and Top 5 at the Handelsblatt Energy Awards 2020 January 29, 2020 (updated February 25, 2020) | By Niko Nather | 0 Comments With Microsoft, Solytic gains a strong technology partner through the \\u201cMicrosoft for Startups\\u201d initiative. \\u201cThe partnership gives us access to the cloud technology Azure and other benefits that allow us to continue our rapid growth,\\u201d said Steffen Mangold, CTO of Solytic. \\u201cCurrently, more than 100,000 PV plants regularly send us their data, some of which go back up to 20 years. In the coming years we want to grow to over 1 million solar plants. For this we need the appropriate infrastructure to be able to analyze the data volumes safely and reliably. A strong technology partner like Microsoft is a huge advantage.\\u201d Microsoft had announced on its blog that it would become not only CO2-neutral, but CO2-negative: \\u201cWhile the world will need to reach net zero, those of us who can afford to move faster and go further should do so. That\\u2019s why today we are announcing an ambitious goal and a new plan to reduce and ultimately remove Microsoft\\u2019s carbon footprint.\\u201d \\u201cThis is an ambitious but necessary vision. We are proud that our partner wants to play a pioneering role here and that words are followed by actions,\\u201d says Mangold. Solytic\\u2019s solution also pleased the expert jury at the Handelsblatt Energy Awards 2020, which voted the Berlin-based company into the top 5 out of 152 contestants in the category \\u201cStart-ups\\u201d. Solytic hits 100,000 solar PV plants under management only 2 years after launch January 8, 2020 (updated January 16, 2020) | By Niko Nather | 0 Comments Solytic was founded in September 2017 and passed the milestone of 100,000 connected PV plants just before Christmas 2019. Never before has a company developed so quickly in terms of connected sites after launch. The following factors have led to this growth: Our software focus. The attractive pricing model. Our hardware independence: Solytic can work with any installed inverter or data logger without the need for new hardware. Organic growth and as white-label solution. Customers benefit from lower monitoring fees and a one-fits-all solution to integrate the entire PV portfolio into a single solution. The chart contains selected PV players with relevant portfolio and public figures. The points indicate the current number of installations in relation to the years since launch. The lines do not represent the actual growth over the years, but only put the current figures in relation to the year of foundation and are intended as a visual aid.

SchenkerFollowJul 29, 2019 \\u00b7 5 min readLike other energy companies, Sweden\\u2019s Vattenfall, one of Europe\\u2019s largest producers of electricity and heat, is grappling with smaller margins, increased competition and adapting an asset-heavy business to an increasingly data-centric, service-driven world.\\u201cWe saw how digitalization was changing other industries intensely and didn\\u2019t have a clue how it would effect energy markets in the future,\\u201d says Juliane Schulze, who heads up business development for renewable energy assets at the utility, which sells electricity, heat, gas and energy services to around 14 million customers in Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, Denmark and the U.K.Eager to create new revenue streams, the utility set up a new firm from scratch in 2017 and enticed outsiders to run it. Today, that company, Berlin-based Solytic, is running a vendor-independent solar analytics platform with the aim of cutting the cost of operating photovoltaic panels for business customers such as maintenance companies servicing factories, small and medium sized businesses, and farms. The company\\u2019s technology \\u2014 which includes artificial intelligence and Internet of Things hardware \\u2014 replaces manual monitoring systems. It is able to tell businesses in real-time that one or more of its photovoltaic (PV) power plants is only operating at a fraction of full-capacity, that this is abnormal based on the data collected from similar installations, and make a recommendation.Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that installed solar capacity will increase 14-fold worldwide by 2040. This is expected to lead to a growing demand for tools that help optimize return on investment. Solytic\\u2019s own market research estimates that around 25% of all solar-PV installations are underperforming.But that is just the start. The plan is to evolve the service to a multi-sector platform business model that will not only leverage the vast amounts of data it collects from solar installations but also add in other sectors, such as insurance and financial services.\\u201cSolytic\\u2019s ability to aggregate millions of data points across hundreds of thousands of solar energy assets will ultimately not only make these assets more efficient for their owners but lay the groundwork for a decentralized, large-scale trading platform that our future digital energy economy needs,\\u201d says Michael Stephanblome, a co-founder of Factor10, an independent corporate company builder that helped Vattenfall build Solytic.Moving From A 10X Factor On Margins To 100X Or MoreAlthough Vattenfall\\u2019s wind and solar renewal energy businesses are relatively young, the division had already grown to over 500 people by 2016 \\u2014 about 80% of them engineers \\u2014 and had established structures and processes that made it difficult to be entrepreneurial and agile, says Schulze.\\u201cWe wanted to understand what the energy market looks like from the perspective of entrepreneurs, to know how they see the world through their digital glasses, to look at what we could learn from business models from totally different industries and how we could transform from being asset driven to being data driven,\\u201d she says.To that end, Schulze started speaking to members of the Berlin startup community and eventually connected with Factor10, a member of the World Economic Forum\\u2019s Digital Platforms & Ecosystems working group, which focuses on how to best apply the platform business model to traditional industries. Factor10\\u2019s team is comprised of over 100 tech entrepreneurs and industry experts with a long track record in the European startup and digital ecosystem. It partners with big corporations and helps them create new digital ventures and adopt the powerful platform business models that the world\\u2019s largest Internet companies have used to grow exponentially. (Other clients include Adidas and Allianz.)Brainstorming with Factor10 led to the idea of creating a solar monitoring and analytics product that has the potential to grow into a platform business. In July of 2017 Factor10 recruited Johannes Burgard, an engineer and project manager with five years experience working at Airbus and other companies. Initially hired as an entrepreneur-in-residence at Factor10, Burgard began creating a minimally viable product (MVP) with the tech team at Factor10 and Alwin Nagel, a Vattenfall employee who left the parent company to work on the project full-time. Solytic was established as a separate legal entity in the summer of 2017. The young company hit all of its milestones, leading Vattenfall to invest \\u20ac3 million at the end of 2017. Solytic is run by Burgard, Nagel and Konrad Per\\u00e9nyi, an entrepreneur with 11 years of experience working for digital ventures such as Rocket Internet. Shareholding is split among Vattenfall, Factor10 and the three founders.\\u201cChanging a big company is like turning around a tanker,\\u201d says Burgard. \\u201cBut we can be agile and move fast.\\u201dIn addition to an innovative company structure \\u201cSolytic has the ability to really leverage the data that they show to their customers,\\u201d says Schulze. \\u201cThe data science layer is very under-developed in this industry. They have strong partnerships and a strong tech team in place that is able to analyze the root causes for failures. This is a completely new market segment in Europe.\\u201dBy automating and improving on today\\u2019s manual monitoring of industrial PV installations Solytic can, among other things, lower risks for banks and insurance companies, says Burgard. \\u201cThe whole idea of providing knowledge and creating more transparency for every single party that is involved in the community is far more interesting,\\u201d he says. \\u201cBy interlinking service providers with the owners of solar assets we can move from a 10X factor on margins to 100X or more. Tapping into this market will lead to exponential growth. That is where the magic happens.\\u201dVattenfall says it believes in that vision. \\u201cOnce you have cracked the software-as-a-service analytics nut and you have a substantial customer base and you have enough data, you can start to provide a lot of interesting services to clients that are adjacent to the energy market,\\u201d says Schulze. \\u201cFor example, grid operators need detailed data about fluctuations in renewable energy sources. This is very hard to predict. If you can develop data science for weather \\u2014 as one example \\u2014 and the analytics are developed well enough you can grab a substantial share of that market. Car-sharing companies may want to use time-sharing cars when prices are cheap because solar production is cheap. That could be a very nice service for this kind of customer group. And if you are able to provide information about the performance of assets to insurance companies or banks that help them judge their risks that could also be a valuable service. There is the possibility with this platform to create a whole ecosystem of services based on data.\\u201dJ.L.S.This article originally appeared in The Innovator\\u2019s January 2019 Davos issue.The Innovator newsConnecting Business with TechnologyFollow11 EnergyBusiness Model InnovationPlatform EconomyDeepdive11 claps11 clapsWritten byJennifer L.

Our Website uses the Google Maps service for facility search provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (\\\"Google\\\"). For this purpose your IP address is transmitted to a Google server in the USA. Also, in the USA, the certification of Google according to the so-called \\\"Privacy Shield Agreement\\\" between the EU and the USA (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt00000000001L5AAI&status=Active) ensures a data protection level adequate to the data protection level in the EU. Google is jointly responsible with us for data processing under Google Maps and has entered into an appropriate agreement with us, which you can view at https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/maps-controller-terms/. For more information about Google's privacy practices, please visit https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/. You can find more information on the other third-party service providers we use to provide the Website to you at the end of this Privacy Statement in our note on cookies, web analytics and tracking tools. We also transmit your data to our hosting service provider, which enables us to provide the Website. This is Hetzner Online GmbH, Industriestr. 25, 91710 Gunzenhausen, Germany. Data processing outside the EEA: We do not transfer your access and account data to countries outside the EEA (so-called \\\"third countries\\\"). We do not host your data in third countries and all your data is stored on the servers of our hosting service provider located in Germany. However, Google's services require transmission to the USA. We will ensure that an adequate level of data protection is guaranteed at all times. We ensure that data recipients are either certified according to the EU Privacy Shield (as is currently the case with Google) or that the EU standard contractual clauses are included in our contracts with these providers to ensure the security of processing and an adequate level of data protection. Retention times: We process and store your personal data to the extent necessary to fulfil our contractual or legal obligations. Therefore, we store the data as long as our contractual relationship with you exists and after termination only to the extent and for as long as the law of the Federal Republic of Germany requires. If the remaining data is no longer required to fulfil legal obligations (e.g. under tax or commercial law), it will be deleted regularly unless further processing is necessary to preserve evidence or defend against legal claims against us. For the preservation of evidence necessary is e.g. your IP address and the exact time of the granting, if you have given us a consent. User profiles: We use your data to create a user profile. This means that we use your information to provide you with a personalized Website based on your personal preferences and interests, and to provide you with customized offers based on your previous behaviour. However, we will never process and analyse your personal data within the framework of this user profile in such a way that this leads to an automated decision which is legally valid for you or which similarly significantly affects you. Your statutory rights under the GDPR: You can assert the following rights against us within the framework of the GDPR with regard to your personal data: Your right to access to your personal data pursuant to Article 15 GDPR, Your right to rectification pursuant to Article 16 GDPR, Your right to erasure Article 17 GDPR, Your right to restriction of processing in accordance with article 18 GDPR and Your right to data portability according to article 20 GDPR. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the responsible data protection supervisory authority (Article 77 GDPR in conjunction with \\u00a7 19 of the German Data Protection Act 2018). In addition, you can also revoke your consent to the processing of your personal data at any time. However, this revocation only applies for the future. Any processing that took place before the revocation remains unaffected by this. Information on your right to object under Art. 21 GDPR In addition to the rights already mentioned, you have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to object at any time to the processing of your personal data, which takes place on the basis of Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. e) GDPR (data processing in the public interest) and Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f) GDPR (data processing on the basis of a weighing of interests). If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can prove compelling reasons for the processing worthy of protection which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims. You also have the right at any time to object to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of direct marketing (including subscription to our newsletter); this also applies to the creation of a user profile (so-called \\\"profiling\\\"), insofar as it is associated with direct marketing. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data in the future. Please note that if you do not provide us with certain data or if you object to the use of this data, you will not use the Website or only use it to a limited extent. The objection can be filed informally and is to be addressed to: info@solytic.com Changes to this Privacy Statement To keep this information up to date, this Privacy Statement will be changed when the underlying data processing is changed. We will publish any intended changes to this Privacy Statement in advance if its content changes and not merely if editorial changes are made (e.g. to correct typographical errors). Use of cookies, web analytics and other tracking tools on our Website The Website uses the following types of cookies, the scope and functionality of which are explained below: Transient cookies and persistent cookies. Transient cookies are automatically deleted when you close your browser. This includes session cookies in particular. They store a so-called session ID, which can be used to assign various requests from your browser to the shared session. This allows your computer to be recognised when you return to our Website. Session cookies are deleted when you log out or close your browser. Persistent cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which may vary depending on the cookie. You can delete the cookies in the security settings of your browser at any time. You can reset your browser before or after your visit to our Website so that all cookies are rejected, or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. By default, the setting of cookies can be managed by the browser programme of your browser, even so that no cookies may be set at all or that cookies are deleted again. Your browser may also have a feature for anonymous browsing. You can use these functions of your browser yourself at any time. If you deactivate the setting of cookies in your browser by default, it is possible, however, that our web pages do not function correctly. The legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Google Analytics Our Website uses Google Analytics, a service provided by Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (\\\"Google Ireland\\\"), a subsidiary of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (\\\"Google\\\"). Google Analytics uses cookies and helps us to analyse the number of users and the general behaviour of visitors to our Website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our Website (identifier, browser type/version, operating system used, referrer URL, shortened IP address, time of server request) is generally transmitted to a Google server in the U.S. and stored there. However, in the Member States of the European Union or in other signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, your IP address will initially be shortened by Google on our Website. For this purpose, we have implemented the code \\\"gat._anonymizeIp() ;\\\" in order to ensure pseudonymized collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). Only in exceptional cases will the complete IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and abbreviated there. If, exceptionally, personal data is transferred to the USA, Google's certification according to the so-called \\\"Privacy Shield Agreement\\\" between the EU and the USA (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt00000000001L5AAI&status=Active) ensures a level of data protection corresponding to the data protection level in the EU. Google will use the information about your use of the Website on our behalf in the context of Google Analytics to evaluate your use of the Website, to compile reports on Website activity and to provide other services relating to Website activity and internet usage. The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager is not combined with other data from Google by us. In addition to generally deactivating cookies, you can prevent Google from collecting and processing data about your use of our Website (including your abbreviated IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in at the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Further information on the terms of use and data protection can be found at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html and https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/. Google Analytics advertising functions and Google Ads We also use Google Ads to advertise on the Websites of third parties. In relation to the data of the advertising campaigns, we can determine how successful the individual advertising measures are. We pursue with it the interest to show you advertisement which is of interest for you and to make our web page more interesting for you. Google uses so-called \\\"ad servers\\\" for this purpose, through which our ads are delivered. For this purpose, we use Ad Server Cookies, which can be used to measure certain parameters such as the display of ads or clicks by users. If you access our Website via a Google advertisement, Google Adwords stores a cookie in your PC. These cookies usually lose their validity after 30 days and cannot be used by us to identify you personally. The unique cookie ID, number of ad impressions per placement (frequency), last impression (relevant for post-view conversions) and opt-out information (marking that the user no longer wishes to be addressed) are usually stored as analysis values for this cookie. These cookies enable Google to recognise your Internet browser for advertising purposes. If a user visits certain pages of an AdWords customer's Website and the cookie stored on his or her computer has not yet expired, Google can track whether the user clicked on the ad and was directed to that page. Each Adwords customer is assigned a different cookie. Cookies cannot therefore be traced via the Websites of Adwords customers. We can never personally identify you with the information we collect and only receive aggregated reports about user behaviour. On the basis of these evaluations, we can identify which of the advertising measures used are particularly effective. We do not receive any further data from the use of the advertising media, in particular we cannot identify the users on the basis of this information. You can also opt out of participating in this tracking process via Google's preferences at https://www.google.de/settings/ads, or as part of the About Ads self-regulatory campaign via the link http://www.aboutads.info/choices, where this setting will be deleted if you delete your cookies. You can also disable it in your browser by installing a plugin if you click on the following link: http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. Further information on data processing within the framework of Google Ads can be found at https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en and https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/. Facebook Pixel Tag The Facebook pixel is installed on our Website. An overview of the Facebook plugins can be found here: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. These are services of Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (\\\"Facebook EU\\\"), which also transmit data to Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA (\\\"Facebook USA\\\"; together with Facebook EU as a whole \\\"Facebook\\\").

Zapier's Privacy Shield certificate can be viewed at: https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TNk2AAG. Albacross On our Website we also use the Albacross pixel, a service of Albacross Nordic AB, Kungsgatan 26, 111 35 Stockholm, Sweden (\\\"Albacross\\\"). We use Albacross for B2B marketing and lead generation. As soon as you visit our Website, your IP address, your refer URL and a so-called fingerprint of your terminal device (screen resolution, browser type and version, operating system, device type) will be sent to Albacross. Albacross then compares this data with its own database and the companies stored there to determine whether you are one of these companies. The data collected with the pixel-code will not be used to personally identify you as a visitor to this Website without your separate consent. The sole purpose of data processing is to identify which IP address with the Albacross tracking code belongs to a company and thus to identify which companies have visited our Website and, on the basis of this data, to make targeted advertisements to these companies. Further information on data processing by Albacross can also be found at https://albacross.com/privacy-policy/.

The certificate can be viewed at: https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TO6hAAG. MailChimp uses this information for the dispatch and statistical evaluation of the newsletter on our behalf. For evaluation purposes, the e-mails sent also contain tracking pixels that represent one-pixel image files that are invisible to the eye. In this way it can be determined whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links have been clicked. Technical information is also recorded (e.g. time of access, IP address, browser type and operating system). The data will be collected exclusively pseudonymized and will not be linked to your other personal data, a direct personal reference is excluded. This data is used exclusively for statistical analysis. The results of these analyses can be used to better tailor future newsletters to the interests of recipients. If you wish to object to the data analysis for statistical evaluation purposes, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. Furthermore, MailChimp may use this data in pseudonymised form in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO itself on the basis of its own legitimate interest in the needs-based design and optimisation of the service as well as for market research purposes in order to determine, for example, from which countries the recipients come. However, MailChimp does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write to them or pass them on to third parties.

About a year ago, he learnt of Solytic. Previously, Kondula was long convinced that no one from outside could better display their internal IT processes, as they themselves. He changed this opinion after a test phase with Solytic for three of their PV plants. The company bos.ten is officially certified by T\\u00dcV Rheinland for the operation and maintenance of PV systems. We have repeatedly tested offerings from various monitoring providers hoping to find a solution where we could integrate and monitor all our assets from one platform. Partly a conversion of the hardware would have been necessary. However, that would have been associated with a financial overhead that we did not want our customers to bear. In turn, without retrofitting, it would have been very expensive to integrate the PV systems into the software at all. Too many different systems One potential monitoring provider worked with open interfaces and would have been able to integrate our assets. However, the cost of onboarding and implementing a sub-user structure for our customers was very high, far too high in the current market scenario. After all, all costs must be earned back by the solar asset. For us, it was very important that the colourful bouquet of PV systems with different technologies and components could be integrated into a portal without horrendous costs. That\\u2019s why we needed a hardware-independent monitoring solution. The portfolio of our operational systems alone comprises ten different inverter manufacturers, each with several different models. In addition, since the commissioning of our oldest power plant in 2003, the technical standard of solar parks has evolved considerably. Solytic was able to meet these requirements with ease and at a price that was extremely attractive compared to the other offerings available in the market. The variety of technology and integration of different component manufacturers was not the only challenge that faced bos.ten. Define users and assign earnings separately One of bos.ten\\u2019s solar parks is owned by more than 20 different investors, all of whom have to receive independent reports. So there is no classic participation model as with most other operators. This unique feature also means a higher effort. We have to be able to map this for each investor accordingly and correctly assign differentiated returns. Solytic was able to address this challenge too. The Berlin-based startup that prides itself in offering tailor-made solutions and was able to provide bos.ten with client and investor access as specifically required. After a short test phase with three assets, it became clear that the Solytic software was well suited to our requirements. The attractive price-performance ratio also played a role in our decision. Synergies through generalization Of course, having your own DIY solution also has its advantages; you can map everything just as it seems important and meaningful to your own company. For example, our clients require validated forecasting from yield assessments to finance their PV system. Accordingly, these commercial target values \\u200b\\u200bin our previous portal solution were compared with the generated earnings. These commercial values \\u200b\\u200bare irrelevant to Solytic\\u2019s technical plant monitoring. Therefore, you have to make a few small compromises with such an open solution. You have to wait for certain wishes because the focus from the viewpoint of the programmers is always on a generalization and not on a specialization. Nevertheless, our assessment was clearly in favour of Solytic. Finally, we save ourselves the time and the costs for the further development of the software. And for our sister companies, there were even greater synergies than originally expected: The partnership relationship with Solytic enables us to receive inquiries on nearly all of the bos.ten Group\\u2019s services, including plant control, PV substructures, and construction and maintenance services. An internal cost-benefit calculation made this clear to us. Because we save a lot of work every day if PV monitoring is becoming more automated. Because of this decision-making process, we have now got a good overview of the internal costs of our monitoring, uncovered potential savings and realized that the documentation of our facilities was not always as complete as we thought before. Monitoring is now much more intuitive and faster. Our employees do not need to have such a deep technical understanding of the equipment on site. As a result, the same team size can serve a much larger portfolio, and that drives our planned growth. Interface to CRM built-in A bidirectional interface between the monitoring software and our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) was particularly important to us. All tickets are managed there so that the bookkeeping and customer service have access. Solytic made it possible. We did not have to adapt our company to the software, Solytic provided a tailor-made solution. Last but not least, we also play an active role in the development of new features that add value to both sides. Advantages of a professional software solution outweigh For each decision, the pros and cons need to be weighed and that\\u2019s exactly what we did in this case. In the first step, we looked at and tested all relevant professional software solutions and compared the best of them with our in-house developed solution. In our case, we decided on Solytic, as we saw the greatest cost/benefit efficiency for us, especially in the long term. Make the right decision for your company! In gerneral we encourage everyone to test all viable solutions to make sure, that the right decision is made. For that reaseon Solytic offers a live demo account, so you can properly get to know the portal.
